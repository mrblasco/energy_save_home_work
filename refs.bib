	abstract = {One of the most exciting areas of research today is the use of
   experiments informed by behavioral science to understand how to change
   energy consumption decisions of consumers. This article provides a
   survey and synthesis of experiments and focuses on general principles
   that can be gleaned from these experiments to date. We identify four
   general insights from the literature. First, the ``law of demand{''} is
   typically satisfied in experimental settings, but responsiveness to
   energy price changes can vary dramatically in different contexts.
   Second, information provision can help promote reductions in energy use,
   but it does not always work. Third, the use of social norms can change
   energy use. Finally, the economic welfare impacts of behavioral
   interventions aimed at promoting either energy conservation or energy
   efficiency are not well understood, but initial research suggests that
   some people want nudges and some do not. The essay also identifies a
   number of areas for future research.},

	abstract = {The financial cost of personal energy consumption is substantial at the
   organizational level. Rarely do incentives for saving energy for the
   individual employee and organization align, making conservation a
   challenge. Here we perform a 12-week field experiment piloting two
   behavioral strategies: (1) social norms feedback and (2) awareness of
   energy monitoring, to encourage savings among 46 administrative staff at
   a university who were given the impression of participating in an energy
   quality study to reduce self-selection bias. Those in the social norms
   feedback condition used significantly less energy during the
   intervention (10\% less energy) and follow up monitoring (11\% less
   energy) phases compared to their baseline consumption. Moreover, these
   participants demonstrated that they learned more about their energy use
   than did those in the awareness monitoring condition. For policy makers
   and building mangers interested in the effectiveness of behavioral
   nudges in inducing energy savings, social norms feedback appears to be
   an effective energy savings nudge in an organizational setting where
   there are neither financial savings at-stake nor intrinsic motivation to
   conserve.},

	abstract = {The Dutch government provides annual, detailed, energy-efficiency
   feedback to individual companies that have signed a voluntary agreement
   to increase their energy efficiency. However, only about 14\% of all
   companies actually download their dedicated report containing this
   feedback. To increase the assumed positive effect of the feedback, the
   Dutch government aims to increase this download rate. Drawing upon
   insights from behavioral economics, the present study investigates the
   effects of alternative emails, inviting to download the feedback report,
   on 505 companies' download behavior, in a randomized controlled field
   experiment with two treatment groups and one control group. The download
   rates for our treatment groups are more than three times higher compared
   to the control group. Survey results indicate that the follow up
   behavior does not differ between the respondents who were nudged and
   those who were not. Moreover, we found indications that downloading the
   report induces the energy coordinators to consider energy-saving
   measures. More generally we have shown that policy targeting energy
   saving of firms can benefit from using behavioral insights. Relatively
   small changes in the implementation of specific interventions can have
   large influences on the effectiveness of the policy.},

	abstract = {Investments in energy efficiency entail uncertainty, and when faced with
   uncertainty consumers have been shown to behave according to prospect
   theory: preferences are reference-dependent and exhibit loss aversion,
   and probabilities are subjectively weighted. Using data from a choice
   experiment eliciting prospect theory parameters, I provide evidence that
   loss-averse people are less likely to invest in energy efficiency. Then,
   I consider policy design under prospect theory when there are also
   externalities from energy use. A higher degree of loss aversion implies
   a higher subsidy to energy efficiency. Numerical simulations suggest
   that the impact of prospect theory on policy may be substantial. (C)

@article{caballero2021tackling,
	abstract = {Behavioral Economics has in recent years played a key role in informing
   the design of non-price interventions aimed at promoting energy
   conservation behaviors in residential housing. Some of the most
   influential contributions of the discipline in an applied setting have
   centered around the development of norm-based interventions. The success
   that these interventions have had in specific contexts presents an
   opportunity to exploit them as tools for tackling a prevalent type of
   poverty at the EU level: energy poverty. Recent contributions to the
   literature highlight the role of inefficient energy behavior as a
   significant driver of this particular type of poverty, which is
   characterized by an inability to afford the basic energy services
   necessary to guarantee a decent standard of living. Therefore, the
   effectiveness of norm-based interventions in vulnerable populations
   merits further investigation to determine whether this approach can
   suitably address the behavioral components of energy poverty by
   promoting efficient energy consumption and conservation efforts. This
   study reports on a pilot conducted in an exemplary social housing
   context (located in Bolzano, Italy) with the aim to assess the
   effectiveness of social comparison interventions in energy vulnerable
   groups. Our investigated cohort covers an initial small sample of
   apartments with a large representatives of elderly individuals and other
   energy-vulnerable groups. Using a design that combines appeals to
   injunctive and descriptive norms embedded within In-Home Devices (IHD)
   in recently retrofitted homes, our objective is to set a basis for the
   assessment of effectiveness of these types of interventions in social
   housing populations. Our study seeks to provide useful methodological
   insights to policy makers on how to effectively design behaviorally
   informed interventions aimed at tackling energy poverty. Despite the
   current data limitations, our results do seem to suggest that uniformly
   applied norm-based interventions may have potentially backfiring effects
   in small-scale implementations. Therefore, they suggest that attention
   needs to be paid to household composition and pre-existing levels of
   consumption, when designing behavior-change interventions in these
   groups.},

	abstract = {Should policy-makers combine price incentives with behavioural nudges to
   encourage sustainable energy behaviour? Available evidence from various
   behavioural sciences is scarce and inconclusive about synergy of the two
   instruments. This is partly due to methodological limitations. We offer
   a framework to overcome such limitations in future research and to guide
   policy-making. It includes four cases: no synergy, positive synergy,
   weak negative synergy, and strong negative synergy or backfire. The
   adoption of a policy mix is recommended in the first two cases, and may
   be pursued in the third case. To clarify the underlying mechanisms of
   the synergy, a distinction is made between crowding (in/out) of
   intrinsic motivations by incentives and crowding (in/out) of extrinsic
   motivations by nudges. This distinction turns out to be especially
   relevant in the case of weakly negative synergy, as here behavioural and
   temporal spillover effects require consideration from the policy-maker
   as well. We end with broader reflections regarding other policy criteria
   for the design of an adequate energy policy mix.},

   involved ``boosts{''} (provision of information) and ``goals{''}
   (ambitious or modest goals) by means of a field experiment conducted in
   the Principality of Monaco between December 2018 and May 2019. We
   collected data from 77 households in four groups: ambitious electricity
   reduction goal combined with information (Treatment 1), modest
   electricity reduction goal combined with information (Treatment 2), only
   information (Treatment 3), and a control group (CG). Treatments 1 and 2
   increased the chances of reduced electricity consumption. We show that a
   modest, more realistic electricity saving goal when combined with a
   ``boost{''} generates better electricity conservation performance (T2).
   We explore the link between behavioral strategies and the household's
   concern for the environment in the context of the new ecological
   paradigm (NEP). Our results show that treatments T1 and T2 are efficient
   for reducing electricity consumption only in households with high levels
   of environmental concern; those whose level of concern about the
   environment is low will not respond to any of the behavioral
   interventions. We provide some recommendations for the implementation of

	abstract = {This paper provides field evidence from India examining changes in
   electricity consumption in response to various behavioral interventions.
   I study the impact of (i) weekly reports with peer comparisons of
   electricity use; (ii) reports augmented with monetary incentives to
   reduce consumption and (iii) price variation. I estimate consumption
   changes using a randomized control trial in conjunction with a
   quasi-experiment. Households provided reports alone reduced summer
   season consumption by 7 percent. Price elasticity identified from
   cross-sectional and time series variation was estimated at 0.56. Against
   this benchmark, the impact of peer comparisons alone was equivalent to
   increasing tariffs by about 12.5 percent. Counter-intuitively, when
   weekly reports were augmented with monetary incentives rewarding
   electricity conservation, households no longer reduced consumption.
   Households receiving reports also show higher price elasticity relative
   to controls. These results provide new evidence identifying the response
   of developing country consumers to behavioral interventions while
   examining the interaction of prices, incentives and information. (C)

   utilities and authorities to encourage environmental-friendly behavior
   because of lower financial costs than if price incentives were used.
   However, recent research suggests that these measures might be
   emotionally taxing for utility consumers. In this article, we present
   the results from a randomized field experiment conducted on a sample of
   1967 customers serviced by a Danish electricity company. Our results
   support the suggestion that socially motivated appeals are significantly
   more emotionally taxing than monetary incentives. We find that this
   difference disappears when the pro-social appeal is supplemented with a
   monetary incentive. Finally, we suggest a strategy for reducing
   emotional `costs' of pro-social appeals without increasing financial
   costs or reducing the effectiveness of the appeal.},

   This article evaluates the impacts of information nudges on residential

   monthly email newsletters and an online energy service platform. The aim
   is to find out whether i) energy saving tips combined with and without
   online energy service platform providing electricity consumption
   information, and ii) peer comparisons (i.e., social norm) influence
   households' electricity consumption. The results show a high seasonal
   variation in the treatment effects within the groups who were registered
   users of the online energy service platform. Those with access to usage
   feedback and versatile energy savings tips (without the social norm
   comparisons) reduced their electricity consumption around 10\% in
   wintertime. The results imply challenges in encouraging energy saving
   behavior among households less interested in following their electricity

@article{ferraro2013heterogeneous,
	abstract = {Policymakers often rely on non-pecuniary, information-based programs to
   achieve social objectives. Using data from a water conservation
   information campaign implemented as a randomized controlled trial, we
   estimate heterogeneous household responses. Understanding such
   heterogeneity is important for improving the cost-effectiveness of
   non-pecuniary programs, extending them to other populations and probing
   the mechanisms through which the treatment effects arise. We find little
   evidence of heterogeneous responses to purely technical information or
   to traditional conservation messages that combine technical information
   and moral suasion. In contrast, norm-based messages that combine
   technical information, moral suasion and social comparisons exhibit
   strong heterogeneity: households that are wealthier, owner-occupied and
   use more water are more responsive. These subgroups tend to be least
   responsive to pecuniary incentives. We find no evidence that any
   subgroup increases their water use in response to the messages. By
   targeting the messages to subgroups known to be most responsive, program
   costs could be reduced by over 50\% with only a 20\% reduction in the
   treatment effect. Combining theory and data, we also shed light on the
   mechanisms through which the treatment effects arise, which has
   implications for program design and future research on the program's
   welfare effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   widely used approach to promote pro-environmental behavior. This form of
   feedback typically invokes social comparisons by informing households
   about their aggregate electricity consumption relative to others. While
   previous research has shown that aggregate consumption feedback
   translates into significant energy savings, the potential for further
   reductions may remain untapped because households lack knowledge about
   their appliance energy consumption patterns. In this paper, we present
   evidence from a field experiment, where we provide residents with
   feedback about their electricity consumption, specific to a high-energy
   use appliance (i.e. air-conditioner). We provide the relevant social
   norm information by varying the reference group of each resident. We
   find that our appliance-specific feedback is a powerful tool to curb
   electricity consumption. Residents significantly reduce their average
   air-conditioning usage by 17\% in our treatment groups. Notwithstanding,
   our effects are not driven by comparative feedback with respect to
   different reference groups. We interpret this as encouraging evidence to
   promote the use of appliance-specific feedback to realize energy

	abstract = {This study uses high-frequency appliance-level electricity consumption
   data for 124 apartments over 24 months to provide a better understanding
   of appliance-level electricity consumption behavior. We conduct our
   analysis in a standardized set of apartments with similar appliances,
   which allows us to identify behavioral differences in electricity use.
   The Results show that households' estimations of appliance-level
   consumption are inaccurate and that they overestimate lighting use by
   75\% and underestimate plug-load use by 29\%. We find that similar
   households using the same major appliances exhibit substantial variation
   in appliance-level electricity consumption. For example, households in
   the 75th percentile of HVAC usage use over four times as much
   electricity as a user in the 25th percentile. Additionally, we show that
   behavior accounts for 25-58\% of this variation. Lastly, we find that
   replacing the existing refrigerator with a more energy-efficient model
   leads to overall energy savings of approximately 11\%. This is
   equivalent to results from behavioral interventions targeting all
   appliances but might not be as cost effective. Our findings have
   important implications for behavior-based energy conservation policies.

@article{callery2021norm,
	abstract = {Bottom-up solutions targeting individual energy conservation behaviors
   can play an important role in mitigating climate change and other
   environmental problems. Information interventions using social
   comparisons have proven generally effective at improving conservation
   behaviors, yet are largely suboptimal and sometimes fail when not
   adequately designed for their specific context. Environmental managers
   and policy makers need guidance on behavioral intervention design to
   maximize effectiveness. This article reports the results of a randomized
   control trial field experiment that used social comparisons to influence
   individual electricity conservation behaviors in a unique experimental
   setting with homogeneous residential units and no economic incentive for
   subjects to conserve. Two treatment groups receiving information
   feedback with different social comparison reference points exhibited an
   average treatment effect of 6 \% relative to a control group that did
   not receive feedback. Moreover, treated subjects whose baseline behavior
   was more proximate to their relevant comparison group norm exhibited
   stronger response to the treatment (greater than 10 \%) than treated
   subjects whose baseline behavior was more distant from the relevant
   norm. These results demonstrate that individuals may be more responsive
   to social norms when provided with a relevant norm that is more
   proximate to their baseline behavior. Our findings have important
   practical implications for optimal design and implementation of
   behavioral interventions to improve environmental management and achieve
   energy policy goals.},

@article{yeomans2014experimental,
	abstract = {Energy efficiency is an important economic and environmental concern,
   and likewise the correction of current wasteful energy practices. We
   document widespread ``tire pressure neglect{''} - three-quarters of
   drivers waste gas driving on underinflated tires. Negative descriptive
   social norms are one potential cause, but have not been tested in
   high-neglect environments, where those norms are widespread. This
   confounds the mechanism: are these norms signals of private value to
   consumers, or do they imply standards for social judgment from others?
   We conducted a field experiment at gas stations in Chicago - our
   intervention included treatments with information about tire pressure
   neglect, promotions in the form of price reductions from \$0.50 to free,
   a descriptive norm of behavior, and ``help{''} in the form of air pump
   assistance. The treatments are designed to provide the ability to
   consider four potential underlying drivers: information, monetary cost,
   social norms and social pressure. Treatments that only included
   information were ineffective, despite average fuel savings of \$10.51,
   but small promotions had substantial impacts. When the air pump price
   was free, the social norm discouraged inflation. However, when the
   research assistant offered help, inflation rates were buoyed by the
   social norm. These results highlight the importance of incentives over
   mere information treatments, and offer a new perspective on how
   information and monetary levers can influence decision-making in the
   presence of negative social norms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

	abstract = {In a large-scale randomized field experiment in Chisinau, Moldova, with
   over 120,0 0 0 households, we tested the influence of a simple, one-time
   letter presenting electricity usage social comparison feedback. The
   letter was framed in either kilowatt-hour units or monetary values. We
   find that both letter versions significantly reduce recipient
   households' electricity consumption by 1.7-2.1 percent in the following
   month, and the effect persists for at least three months. The effect's
   magnitude and duration resemble those seen in similar trials in the
   U.S., even though Moldova's average household electricity consumption
   level is much lower. As the first large-scale field experiment testing
   social comparison energy reports in a post-Soviet environment, this
   study provides empirical evidence that non-price nudges can be an
   inexpensive yet useful energy conservation policy tool even in
   non-Western and less industrialized settings. We explore the
   relationship between Moldova's socioecological contexts and
   environmental attitudes as a former Soviet Union country and the

	abstract = {The UK needs to accelerate action to achieve its 80 per cent carbon
   reduction target by 2050 as it is otherwise in danger of lagging behind.
   A much discussed question in this context is whether voluntary behaviour
   change initiatives can make a significant contribution to reaching this
   target.
   While providing individuals with general information on climate change
   or low carbon action is increasingly seen as ineffective, some studies
   argue that personalised information has greater potential to encourage
   behaviour change. This mixed methods study examines this claim through a
   longitudinal field experiment which tested the effectiveness of a carbon
   calculator interview. It finds that the intervention significantly
   raised awareness of ways in which participants could reduce their carbon
   footprint. However, this increased awareness did not translate into
   measurable behaviour changes in relation to home energy and travel.
   Qualitative analysis shows that participants refer to infrastructural,
   social and psychological barriers to change. This indicates that more
   ambitious government and corporate action is required to speed up carbon
   reduction.},

@article{bhanot2017rank,
	abstract = {Perception of peer rank, or how we perform relative to our peers, can be
   a powerful motivator. While research exists on the effect of social
   information on decision making, there is less work on how ranked
   comparisons with our peers influence our behavior. This paper outlines a
   field experiment conducted with 3896 households in Castro Valley,
   California, which uses household mailers with various forms of social
   information and peer rank messaging to motivate water conservation. The
   experiment tests the effect of a visible peer rank on water use, and how
   the competitive framing of rank information influences behavioral
   response. The results show that households with relatively low or high
   water use in the pre-treatment period responded differently to how rank
   information was framed. I find that a neutrally-framed peer rank caused
   a small ``boomerang effect{''} (i.e., an increase in average water use)
   for low water use households, but this effect was eliminated by
   competitive framing. At the same time, a competitively-framed peer rank
   demotivated high water use households, increasing their average water
   use over the full period of the experiment. This result is supported by
   evidence that the competitive frame on rank information increased water
   use for households who ranked ``last{''} in the peer group - a
   detrimental ``last place effect{''} from competitively-framed rankings.

	abstract = {Residential energy conservation is a key component of contemporary
   energy, and climate change policy in the US and elsewhere. Comparisons
   of the relative effectiveness of measures aimed at reducing residential
   energy consumption are made challenging, however, by the endogeneity of
   technology and energy use decisions. In this paper we describe a novel
   small-scale field experiment that uses randomized treatments to estimate
   the returns to three types of energy conservation measures in
   institutionally owned homes. The results from the experiment indicate
   considerable reductions in natural gas consumption associated with the
   installation of attic insulation and the provision of incentives for
   conservation. The results are supported by observations of ambient
   indoor temperature data, which show that households receiving incentives
   significantly reduce their temperature settings especially when coupled
   with access to a programmable thermostat. The study will ideally provide
   guidance for institutions and communities considering energy efficiency
   measures and for future researchers designing randomized experiments to
   study residential energy use. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   the effects of three nudges on employees' energy conservation are
   tested. The first nudge, ``moral appeal{''}, stresses the responsible
   use of energy. The second one, ``social comparison{''}, informs
   employees on the energy consumption of other firms participating in the
   experiment. Finally, the third nudge, ``stickers{''}, alerts employees
   about good energy conservation practices. Our results stress the
   complementarity of these nudges. When implemented alone, the three
   nudges have no significant effects on energy consumption. However, when
   the moral appeal and social comparison nudges are combined with the
   stickers nudge, they become effective.},
