\textbf{Key Points: Spillovers and Peer Effects}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,labelsep=5mm]
    \item Energy conservation policies at home and work are interconnected through spillovers, which refer to the effects of policy interventions on non-targeted behaviours.
    \item Spillovers can be positive or negative, impacting the overall effectiveness of a policy.
    \item Types of spillovers include behavioural, temporal, contextual, and social spillovers, each with its own characteristics and implications.
    \item Evidence shows the existence of spillovers in energy conservation, such as rebound effects, temporal spillovers in retrofitting behavior, contextual spillovers in food waste reduction, and social spillovers in the adoption of clean energy technologies.
    \item Understanding and leveraging spillovers can enhance policy design and evaluation, with strategies like promoting habit formation, fostering a green identity, encouraging commitment, addressing moral licensing, and leveraging peer effects.

Even though we have treated policies promoting energy conservation at home and work separately so far, they are strongly interlinked. The concept of "spillover" is often used to describe this connection, as it refers to the effects of policy interventions on multiple non-targeted behaviours.

Spillovers can be positive or negative depending on whether the effects on the non-targeted behaviours are in the direction of the desired change. This distinction is essential to understand the net effect of a policy. For example, a policy that positively affects the targeted behaviour may still produce a net negative result if the adverse effects on off-target behaviours offset the positive ones. 

One critical step in the analysis of spillovers is to identify areas or situations where they may arise. A deep analysis of the academic literature by Nilsson and others [-@nilsson2017spillover] suggests classifying spillovers into various types based on the following distinctions  (see also Table \ref{tab:spillovers}):

- **Behavioural Spillovers.** This category refers to the effects of one behavioural intervention on non-targeted behaviours. For example, a policy reducing households' electricity consumption by raising individuals' environmental concerns could also affect people's inclinations towards recycling, eco-driving, and other non-targeted pro-environmental behaviours.

- **Temporal Spillovers.** These spillovers occur when the effect of one behavioural intervention at a given time also influences the same behaviour in the future. For example, educating children to save energy will affect their current behaviour, but it could also influence their behaviour later in life.

- **Contextual Spillovers**. These arise when the effect of one behavioural intervention transfers from one context to another. For example, interventions that persuade households to consume less energy at home could also stimulate energy savings at work.

- **Social Spillovers**. These refer to the influence that choices by others may have on individual choices. Unlike other spillovers, they occur between individuals. For example, an intervention informing school children about energy savings at school could also affect the information, and thus energy consumption, of their family and friends.


Multiple studies have investigated spillovers in the context of energy conservation. One such study is a meta-analysis of 22 experimental studies, which provides evidence of significant behavioural spillovers [@maki2019meta]. One example of spillover observed is the "rebound effect," which refers to an increase in consumption after an investment in energy-efficient equipment. This may happen when the initial energy savings of the equipment may lead to increased consumption, which can ultimately negate the energy savings achieved through the investment [@aydin2017energy].

A study by Egner and Klöckner [-@egner2021temporal], based on a large-scale survey of Norwegian households, found evidence of temporal spillovers in energy retrofitting behaviour. Specifically, they found that households who completed energy retrofits once were more likely to retrofit their homes again three years later. These findings suggest that the initial retrofitting behaviour had a positive spillover effect, leading to continued interest and commitment to energy efficiency over time. 

Yes, there is still a need for more evidence on contextual spillovers in energy consumption across home and work. However, in the context of food waste, there is evidence of positive spillovers across these contexts. A quasi-experimental study shows that efforts to reduce food waste in the workplace are associated with food-saving actions at home [@wang2021take]. 

In the context of energy conservation, there is evidence of a strong positive association between energy consumption at home and work via surveys [@littleford2014context; @lin2019mixing]. This association has been further tested in laboratory experiments, which have confirmed a positive link [@alt2022incentives]. However, there is still a need for more experimental evidence in the field to better understand the potential for spillovers in energy conservation across different contexts.

The evidence of social spillovers is also conspicuous. Research has shown that solar cell deployment becomes more likely if the neighbours have installed this technology on their roofs [@bale2013harnessing]. This suggests that one individual or household's actions can influence others' behaviour in their social network or neighbourhood, leading to a ripple effect of energy conservation behaviour. By leveraging the power of social spillovers and designing strategies that promote visible and conspicuous displays of energy-saving behaviours, it may be possible to increase the adoption of clean energy technologies and promote sustainable behaviours more broadly.

The presence of spillovers in energy conservation has multiple implications for policy design and evaluation. On the one hand, it complicates the ex-ante cost-benefit analysis and ex-post impact assessment of energy-conservation policies, as discussed by Galizzi and others [-@galizzi2019measure]. If a policy intervention generates spillovers, ignoring these spillovers puts policymakers at risk of underestimating or overestimating the actual impact of one intervention. At the same time, estimating possible spillovers in ex-ante and ex-post evaluations is generally complicated, and more research is needed to provide an easy-to-use framework for policy evaluation.

Regarding policy design, more research is needed to understand how policymakers can leverage spillovers to enhance energy-saving interventions. While the discussion continues, we examine key levers widely studied in the literature as discussed below.

## Habit formation

Social psychologists define a habit as a settled routine or regular
tendency triggered by exposure to the same environmental cues, for
example, turning off the lights when no one is using them. It follows
that once an energy-saving behaviour becomes an established habit, it
does not need nor require specific incentives or motivations to be
triggered, which makes habit formation a particularly appealing
objective for policies, as discussed elsewhere [@van2019drivers].

Various studies examined interventions encouraging efficient
energy-consumption habits showing evidence that policies that stimulate
habit formation are more effective. For example, Ito et al. randomly
assigned households to a dynamic pricing scheme encouraging good energy
conservation habits [@ito2018moral]. Results show that this approach produced
significant energy savings, most of which were thorough habit formation
as the treatment effect persisted even after the intervention had
ceased. This study underscores a more general idea suggesting that habit
formation could explain why one-shot behavioural interventions generate
results on energy conservation that continue over time [@allcott2014short; @jessoe2014knowledge].

## Identity

One way to leverage contextual spillovers is through interventions
encouraging people to adopt a green identity. If people consider
themselves environmentalists, as this notion is part of their identity,
they will show consistent pro-environmental behaviours in multiple
contexts.

Although the evidence on these spillovers is limited, a survey of the UK
public shows that people who self-identify as environmentalists tend to
maintain pro-environmental behaviour in multiple contexts [@whitmarsh2010green]. Moreover, some studies have tested different interventions to foster individuals'
environmental identity. These studies have shown that using cues from
past pro-environmental behaviour and feedback to label a person as an
environmentalist can effectively stimulate a pro-environmental
identity [@geng2019globalize; @gleue2022identity; @fanghella2019use].

## Commitment to the cause

Committing to engage pro-environmentally can positively affect
spillovers. Such a commitment can occur in the form of pledges but also in the form of actual behaviour. Inclining in costly or effortful behaviour for the environment's sake can be considered a self-signal of being committed to a pro-environmental goal. Thereby, subsequent
pro-environmental actions in other contexts become more likely.

There exists evidence that people who gave up on their monetary income for a good cause have been less likely to seize benefits at the expense of others when having the opportunity to thereafter^61^. This shows that commitments in pledges and actions can act as a \"foot in the door\", helping people to focus on a specific goal or objective.

## Moral licensing

Contextual spillovers can also be harmful to energy conservation. For
example, a policy that targets household energy savings may succeed in
reducing energy consumption at home but inadvertently increase energy
consumption at work, with an overall effect that could vary from
positive to negative.

One frequent explanation for negative spillovers implicates the concept
of "moral licensing," which describes a situation in which past good
deeds will lower the probability of engaging in future good
behaviours [@merritt2010moral]. Moral licensing is part of a more general theory of moral balancing [@funder1991explorations; @monin2001moral], which describes how past actions could affect
the probability of engaging in future behaviours, either good/moral or
wrong/immoral.

Several studies have examined moral licensing in various settings to
assess the magnitude of these effects. For instance, a meta-analysis of
91 state-of-the-art experiments shows the effect size of moral licensing
can be considerable [@blanken2015meta]. However, we need more studies focused on the effects of moral licensing on pro-environmental behaviour[^11].

How moral licensing relates to policies is still a largely unexplored
topic. However, using a laboratory experiment in the context of
charitable donations, a recent study shows that interventions offering
monetary incentives to adopt pro-environmental behaviours could backfire
and amplify the adverse effects of moral licensing [@alt2022incentives]. One possible explanation is that a "monetary mindset" induces individuals to
rationalize behaviours differently when offered cash incentives or moral
suasion, as discussed in another related study [@ito2018moral]. Combinations of
monetary incentives with commitment devices or norm interventions could
counteract such negative spillovers, as they foster consistency within a
newly adapted behaviour, as discussed in various studies [@royer2015incentives;@alt2022incentives].

## Peer effects

Policies can influence social dynamics, such as peer effects, to
trigger savings in energy consumption. For example, one intervention
could target a subset of households in each neighbourhood, and the intervention's effects could spread to other families. This diffusion could happen organically, through word of mouth or there might be elements of the policies that foster spreading information, such as referral programs.

The mechanisms behind peer effects are manifold. They can be driven by a
person's desire to comply with the behaviour of others, which is
perceived as an implicit social norm. Social preferences, such as
inequality aversion. If others act, people may feel the need to act as
well. But also social learning by observing what others are doing.

The experimental literature on peer effects is vast, and the size of
peer effects can vary considerably across different contexts. Recent
studies have explored various approaches to promote energy savings in
the work environment [@nye2010exploring] and among households [@wolske2020peer]. However, integrating interventions with peer effects across different settings remains challenging, primarily because social dynamics and interactions vary
substantially across different contexts (e.g., in the office and at
home).

**Takeaways**

-   Office and home energy consumption interventions are interlinked via
    "spillover," which includes policy intervention effects on
    non-targeted behaviours.

-   Spillovers operate across different behaviours and contexts, over
    time, and across individuals.

-   Spillovers complicate the ex-ante cost-benefit analysis and ex-post
    impact assessment of energy-conservation policies.

-   Integrating spillovers into policy design will enhance the
    effectiveness of policy interventions (e.g., habit formation, peer
    effects).
