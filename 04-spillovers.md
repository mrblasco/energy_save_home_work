# Spillovers and Peer Effects {#spillovers}

Policies promoting energy conservation at home and work are strongly interlinked, despite being often treated separately. The concept of "spillover" is often used to describe this connection, as it refers to the effects of policy interventions on multiple non-targeted behaviours.

Spillovers can be positive or negative depending on whether the effects on the non-targeted behaviours are in the direction of the desired change. For example, a policy that positively affects the targeted behaviour may still produce a net negative result if the adverse effects on off-target behaviours offset the positive ones.

One critical step in formulating policies fostering energy savings is identifying areas or situations where spillovers may arise. Analysis of the academic literature by Nilsson and others [-@nilsson2017spillover] suggests classifying spillovers into four categories: _behavioural_, _temporal_, _contextual_, and _social_ (or peer effects). These categories are summarised in Table \ref{tab:spillovers}.

Behavioural Spillovers occur when one behavioural intervention affects non-targeted behaviours. For instance, a policy that reduces household electricity consumption by increasing individuals' environmental concerns may also impact their inclination towards recycling, eco-driving, and other pro-environmental behaviours. Temporal Spillovers occur when a behavioural intervention's effect at one time influences the same behaviour in the future. For example, educating children about energy conservation can impact their present behaviour and actions later in life. Contextual Spillovers arise when the effect of a behavioural intervention transfers from one context to another. For instance, interventions encouraging energy savings at home may also promote energy conservation at the workplace. Finally, Social Spillovers involve the influence of others' choices on individual decisions. For instance, informing school children about the significance of energy savings at school can also impact the energy consumption of their family and friends by transmitting the information.

## Evidence of spillovers

Multiple studies have investigated spillovers in the context of energy conservation. A meta-analysis of 22 experimental studies provides evidence of significant behavioural spillovers [@maki2019meta]. One example of spillover observed is the "rebound effect," which refers to an increase in consumption after an investment in energy-efficient equipment. This effect may happen when the initial energy savings of the equipment may lead to increased consumption, which can ultimately negate the energy savings achieved through the investment [@aydin2017energy].

<!-- (Dütschke et al. 2018).[^10] -->

A large-scale survey of Norwegian households found evidence of temporal spillovers in energy retrofitting behaviour [@egner2021temporal]. Specifically, households who completed energy retrofits once were more likely to retrofit their homes again three years later, even after controlling for individual demographic differences. These findings suggest that the initial retrofitting behaviour had a positive spillover effect, leading to continued interest and commitment to energy efficiency over time. This association has been further tested in laboratory experiments, which have confirmed a positive temporal spillover [@alt2022incentives].

Evidence on contextual spillovers in energy consumption is lacking, although surveys found a strong positive association between energy consumption at home and work [@littleford2014context; @lin2019mixing]. In the somewhat related context of food waste, a quasi-experimental study shows that efforts to reduce food waste in the workplace are associated with food-saving actions at home @wang2021take, consistent with a positive spillover from the workplace to the household.

<!-- However, there is still a need for more experimental evidence in the field to better understand the potential for spillovers in energy conservation across different contexts. -->

The evidence of social spillovers is also conspicuous. Research has shown that solar cell deployment becomes more likely if the neighbours have installed this technology on their roofs [@bale2013harnessing]. This finding suggests that one individual or household's actions can influence others' behaviour in their social network or neighbourhood, leading to a ripple effect of energy conservation behaviour. By leveraging the power of social spillovers and designing strategies that promote visible and conspicuous displays of energy-saving behaviours, it may be possible to increase the adoption of clean energy technologies and promote sustainable behaviours more broadly.

<!-- Move to conclusions -->

Overall, spillovers in energy conservation have multiple implications for policy design and evaluation. On the one hand, it complicates the ex-ante cost-benefit analysis and ex-post impact assessment of energy-conservation policies, as discussed by Galizzi and others [-@galizzi2019measure]. If a policy intervention generates spillovers, ignoring these spillovers puts policymakers at risk of underestimating or overestimating the actual impact of one intervention. At the same time, estimating possible spillovers in ex-ante and ex-post evaluations is generally complicated, and more research is needed to provide an easy-to-use framework for policy evaluation.

## Leveraging Spillovers

Regarding policy design, more research is needed to understand how policymakers can leverage spillovers to enhance energy-saving interventions. While the discussion continues, we examine key levers widely studied in the literature, as discussed below.

### Habit formation

Social psychologists define a habit as a settled routine or regular tendency triggered by exposure to the same environmental cues, for example, turning off the lights when no one is using them. It follows that once an energy-saving behaviour becomes an established habit, it does not need nor require specific incentives or motivations to be triggered, which makes habit formation a particularly appealing objective for policies, as discussed elsewhere [@van2019drivers].

Various studies examined interventions encouraging efficient energy-consumption habits showing evidence that policies that stimulate habit formation are effective. For example, Ito et al. [-@ito2018moral] randomly assigned households to a dynamic pricing scheme encouraging good energy conservation habits. Results show that this approach produced significant energy savings, most of which were through habit formation as the treatment effect persisted even after the intervention had ceased. This study underscores a more general idea suggesting that habit formation could explain why one-shot behavioural interventions generate results on energy conservation that continue over time [@allcott2014short; @jessoe2014knowledge].

### Identity

One way to leverage contextual spillovers is through interventions encouraging people to adopt a green identity. If people consider themselves environmentalists, as this notion is part of their identity, they will show consistent pro-environmental behaviours in multiple contexts.

Although the evidence on these spillovers is limited, a survey of the UK public shows that people who self-identify as environmentalists tend to maintain pro-environmental behaviour in multiple contexts [@whitmarsh2010green]. Moreover, some studies have tested different interventions to foster individuals'
environmental identity. These studies have shown that using cues from past pro-environmental behaviour and feedback to label a person as an environmentalist can effectively stimulate a pro-environmental
identity [@geng2019globalize; @gleue2022identity; @fanghella2019use]. Consequently, these cues to people’s environmental identity could be used to stimulate energy conservation behaviour at work and at home.

### Commitment to the cause

Fostering people's commitment to pro-environmental behaviour, such as promoting pledges or specific demonstrative actions, can generate positive contextual spillovers. By inclining in costly or effortful behaviour for the environment's sake, people send a signal of being committed to a pro-environmental goal. As a consequence, subsequent pro-environmental actions in other contexts become more likely. Furthermore, individual commitments are highly linked to the establishment of an environmental identity to which the respective actions positively contribute. For example, @gneezy2012paying shows that people are more likely to behave consistently with their self-perception of being prosocial when they engage in costly prosocial acts. Consequently, commitments in pledges and actions can act as a "foot in the door", helping people to focus on a specific goal or objective. This suggests a viable strategy to promote energy conservation behaviour via pledges, whereby energy providers could encourage consumers to set a goal or make a pledge to save energy in the upcoming year.

### Moral licensing

Contextual spillovers can also be harmful to energy conservation. For example, a policy that targets household energy savings may succeed in reducing energy consumption at home but inadvertently increase energy consumption at work, with an overall effect that could vary from positive to negative. One frequent explanation for negative spillovers implicates the concept of "moral licensing," which describes a situation in which past good deeds will lower the probability of engaging in future good behaviours [@merritt2010moral]. Moral licensing is part of a more general theory of moral balancing [@funder1991explorations; @monin2001moral], which describes how past actions could affect the probability of engaging in future behaviours, either good/moral or wrong/immoral.

Several studies have examined moral licensing in various settings to assess the magnitude of these effects. For instance, a meta-analysis of 91 state-of-the-art experiments shows the effect size of moral licensing can be considerable [@blanken2015meta]. However, we need more studies focused on the effects of moral licensing on energy consumption. Considering energy conservation as a moral behaviour, conservation efforts could be prone to the reasoning of moral balancing/licensing and thereby threatening the achieved energy reduction by consuming energy more in other contexts.

How moral licensing relates to policies is still a largely unexplored topic. However, using an experiment in the context of charitable donations, a recent study shows that interventions offering monetary incentives to adopt pro-environmental behaviours could backfire and amplify the adverse effects of moral licensing [@alt2022incentives]. One possible explanation is that a "monetary mindset" induces individuals to rationalize behaviours differently when offered cash incentives or moral suasion, as discussed in another related study [@ito2018moral]. Combinations of monetary incentives with commitment devices or norm interventions could counteract such negative spillovers, as they foster consistency within a newly adapted behaviour, as discussed in various studies [@royer2015incentives;@alt2022incentives].

## Peer effects

Policies can influence social dynamics, such as peer effects, to
trigger savings in energy consumption. For example, one intervention
could target a subset of households in each neighbourhood, and the intervention's effects could spread to other households. This diffusion could happen organically, through word of mouth or there might be elements of the policies that foster spreading information, such as referral programs.

The mechanisms behind peer effects are manifold. They can be driven by a
person's desire to comply with the behaviour of others, which is
perceived as an implicit social norm. Social preferences, such as
inequality aversion. If others act, people may feel the need to act as
well. But also social learning by observing what others are doing.

The experimental literature on peer effects is vast, and the size of
peer effects can vary considerably across different contexts. Recent
studies have explored various approaches to promote energy savings in
the work environment [@nye2010exploring] and among households [@wolske2020peer]. However, integrating interventions with peer effects across different settings remains challenging, primarily because social dynamics and interactions vary
substantially across different contexts (e.g., in the office and at
home).
