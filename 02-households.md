# Saving energy at home {#sec:home}

Implementing effective policies to reduce household energy consumption is crucial during an energy crisis. Interventions encompass a spectrum of actions, including launching public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about the importance of energy conservation and providing financial incentives and regulatory support for efficiency improvements. The efforts targeted by such interventions include encouraging citizens to take "small actions" like switching off lights and appliances when not in use, cooking more efficiently, and minimising the use of heating and cooling systems. As for efficiency improvement, targeted activities can range from minor home enhancements, like upgrading old windows to reduce heat loss during winter or replacing inefficient electric appliances, to installing photovoltaic panels on the roofs for generating solar energy.

For example, the ["Playing My Part" information campaign](https://www.iea.org/reports/playing-my-part), launched by the European Commission and the IEA in response to energy crisis that ensured Russia's invasion of Ukraine, urged households to adopt small changes in their everyday energy consumption, such as adjusting their boiler settings, turning down heating, using less air-conditioning, and driving their cars more economically. At the same time, the European Commission also proposed to intensify the efforts to facilitate families to switch to energy-efficient technologies, such as purchasing electric heat pumps or installing programmable "smart" thermostats.

Public campaigns to raise awareness of energy-saving opportunities have a long history and reach back to the initial global "energy crisis" experienced in the 1970s. These campaigns offer several advantages over other policy alternatives. They can empower individuals by providing them with tools and information to make better choices. By relying on voluntary actions from the public, campaigns can generate a sense of responsibility and increase acceptance of energy-saving measures.  However, a significant challenge in these campaigns is that despite promoting energy conservation through large-scale information dissemination, only a minority of individuals responded positively. This 'weak adoption' can be attributed to the inherent difficulties of processing the provided information and psychological factors, 

<!-- as indicated by @coltrane1986social, among others. Today, experts agree that successful energy-saving programs must consider economic and behavioural factors. This realisation can be traced back to the research conducted by @shama1983energy, who emphasised the need to integrate these crucial elements into energy conservation initiatives. And there is a large literature on this topic.  -->


<!-- For example, Playing My encourage them to take "small actions" like switching off lights and appliances when not in use, cooking more efficiently, and minimising the use of heating and cooling systems. Another approach is encouraging and incentivizing families to replace outdated appliances, such as substituting traditional incandescent bulbs with modern LED ones, purchasing energy-efficient devices, and integrating "smart" home systems. Home improvements are another target of policies of energy curtailment. These interventions can range from encouraging minor enhancements, like upgrading old windows to reduce heat loss during winter, to providing financial incentives and regulatory support for installing photovoltaic panels for generating solar energy. -->

<!-- These policies have a long history, dating back to the first global 'energy crisis' in the 1970s.  -->


 <!-- These interventions aim to raise awareness of the benefits of energy savings and encourage consumers to prioritize energy efficiency when making choices. Such policies encompass a spectrum of actions, including encouraging behavioural changes, promoting the purchase of energy-efficient equipment, and facilitating investments in home improvements.

On the one hand, the recent increase in retail energy prices due to the surge in wholesale prices caused by the embargo on Russia's fossil fuels may cause people to be more concerned about the impact of higher energy bills. Therefore, individuals may be more inclined to change their energy usage and actively search for ways to reduce their energy consumption to lower their bills. At the same time,  government interventions to calm energy prices, despite being necessary to offer relief to individuals, could weaken the incentive for households to achieve energy savings. 

On the other hand, many studies have shown that, despite receiving basic information about the potential benefits of good energy conservation practices, only a minority of individuals tend to adopt such rules, even when cost-effective [@jaffe1994energy]. This means that most individuals often stick to their usual energy consumption patterns or habits rather than trying to reduce their energy consumption.  

\begin{keypoints}{Classical explanations for the Energy Paradox}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Information barriers} Families face multiple barriers in accessing or absorbing information. For example, a representative survey of Dutch households shows that only about half of respondents are aware of their monthly charges for energy consumption, and only 40\% understand the correct trade-off between different investment decisions in energy equipment [@brounen2013energy].

  \item \textbf{Time discounting} Investments in energy efficiency and, to some extent, significant behavioural changes involve individual costs. These costs are typically immediate (i.e., installation expenses), offering only delayed rewards (i.e., lower electricity bills). However, if families heavily discount the future, they would rather spend their time or money elsewhere today.

  \item \textbf{Heterogeneity in consumption}. Households are widely heterogeneous concerning their energy consumption patterns. Thus, even if a technology (or behaviour) is profitable on *average*, it may remain unattractive for a large portion of the population.
\end{itemize}
\end{keypoints}

Classical explanations for this paradox (see the Box) assume that individuals would make optimal decisions if they had more information about costs and benefits or if the market offered them more personalised solutions to save energy. However, much psychology and behavioural economics evidence have challenged these assumptions because people do not typically make optimal decisions if under the best conditions. On the contrary, individuals often act as if they were predictably "irrational" or biased. 

Based on such evidence, other explanations for the Energy Paradox have emerged. Here, we provide two examples: 

* **Time-inconsistent preferences**. People often delay or postpone action despite knowing there will be negative consequences, a form of procrastination. This phenomenon is known as inconsistent time preferences, where people make choices today that are inconsistent with their future well-being and preferences. For example, people prefer to keep their heating systems at high levels to stay warm and comfortable, but they systematically regret their decision when they receive a high energy bill.  For example, a recent study based on a survey with an experimental design shows that people who exhibited time-inconsistent preferences also tended to over-consume energy at home [@werthschulte2021role].  

* **Loss aversion**. Another example is that, when making energy decisions, individuals may find it too costly to deviate from their current energy consumption patterns or “status quo” because it involves giving up their current comfortable lifestyle, which they have become accustomed to. Therefore, they may resist making changes, even if the potential rewards are significant, due to the fear of loss. This phenomenon is known as loss aversion, where people fear losses more than they seek equivalent gains. A recent study, based on a large-scale survey of EU citizens, shows that individuals who are loss averse are less likely to invest in energy-efficient appliances or retrofit measures [@schleich2019large].

## Interventions to Save Energy at Home

The reasons for the Energy Paradox remain open, and the behavioural factors influencing households' energy decisions are still unclear. So, in this report, we take a more practical approach by exploring different interventions found to be successful in the academic literature. This will help us understand the challenges and effectiveness of other solutions.  Table \ref{tab:households} summarises the interventions discussed below.

### Information Nudges and Energy Labels

Information Nudges is a term to describe policies sending households energy-saving tips or rules of thumb to induce desired energy consumption choices or rectify behavioural biases. These messages are displayed via electricity bills, postcards, emails, and other media. Extensive literature shows that Information Nudges effectively promote energy savings @craig1978assessing; @ruokamo2022effect; @dellavalle2020nudging; @caballero2021tackling. However, multiple factors influence the effectiveness of such measures, including the credibility of the source [@craig1978assessing], the delivery method, and the target groups. At the same time, the impact on energy consumption is of modest size. A recent meta-analysis based on 52 studies between 2005 and 2020 [@buckley2020prices] shows that the average effect of Information Nudges ranges between 2% and 4%. Despite the modest effect size, they are typically inexpensive and easy to deploy and the associated cost-effectiveness prompts their use.

Energy Labels are another form of information nudging to intuitively convey a technology's or commodity's energy efficiency properties. Extensive evidence has proven their effectiveness in various settings, like energy-efficient electric appliances [@dyer1988evaluation; @dellavalle2019can] and residential buildings [@taranu2018closer; @brounen2011economics] tend to promote investments in long-term energy savings. One common explanation for the efficacy of energy labels is that they provide easy-to-grasp information and make the long-term impact of energy expenses more salient, thus helping households to overcome time-inconsistent decision patterns.

### Energy One-stop Shops

One-stop shops are agencies that aim to offer integrated solutions and customer-centric services that simplify the decisional process for the renovation of residential buildings. Indeed, increasing the efficiency of residential buildings through renovations is challenging. It involves a cumbersome and lengthy process in a fragmented market that might discourage consumers. Interventions promoting one-stop shops can bridge the fragmented demand and supply of the renovation value chain. These shops guide citizens and businesses through the renovation journey, from start to finish, and help them overcome hurdles they would otherwise face alone. One-stop shops are relatively new, and so far, 63 case studies have been identified and analysed in Europe [@bertoldi2021role] providing early evidence of their effectiveness. 

### Individual Feedback and Goal Setting

Personalised feedback promotes energy savings by informing households of their energy consumption. There is widespread evidence of their effectiveness, as outlined in several comprehensive reviews [@abrahamse2005review; @andor2018behavioral]. Personalised feedback aims to make energy consumption more "visible" to consumers. Electric companies typically send feedback via periodic email or monthly electricity bills. Sometimes, consumers can receive real-time feedback to adjust their energy consumption to price changes during the day or avoid peaks using smart meters [@aydin2018information]. However, as technology progresses and new ways of communication emerge, more work is needed on designing individual feedback to optimise effectiveness in a fast-changing environment.

Setting specific household energy consumption goals is another
critical application of individual feedback. A recent meta-analysis of
studies that combine feedback with goal settings shows that this
combination consistently reduces the energy consumption of private
households [@andor2018behavioral]. Yet, the effect sizes can vary considerably, suggesting that contextual factors influence the success of policy implementation.

### Intrinsic Motivations and Social Norms

In addition to providing information in an easily understandable manner to consumers, behavioural interventions can impact energy savings by targeting individuals' inner (intrinsic) motivation to save energy. For example, interventions can appeal to individuals' environmental values or willingness to adhere to well-established social norms. These interventions assume that people are intrinsically motivated to save energy and will respond to solicitations without personal benefits or financial incentives [@van2015social]. One specific example of behavioural interventions that use the power of social norms consists of providing individuals with information about how much energy is used by peers or socially approved energy consumption levels, thus supplying social comparisons and norms. Since many individuals care about conforming, this information motivates them to change their energy consumption. Extensive literature has shown the effectiveness of this approach in promoting energy savings [@allcott2011social; @caballero2021tackling].

### Warnings and Fact-checking

Misinformation is an obstacle to energy savings and environmentally
conscious behaviours, like other informational barriers. For example,
studies have shown widespread energy misinformation about politicised
topics such as the causes of global climate change [@oreskes2004scientific; @farrell2019evidence], and fake news underplaying the concerns about climate change can negatively influence people's perception of the problem and their willingness to invest in energy-efficient technology. Similarly, misinformation about energy use could also affect long-term policies of supply diversification, for example, by giving citizens a wrong idea of the risks of nuclear power [@ho2018can; @ho2019environmental; @ho2022fake].

Behavioural interventions, such as warnings and fact-checking, offer a
promising approach to "inoculate" public attitudes against the spread of
misinformation about energy policies. For example, a recent
experimental survey shows that warning people about politically
motivated attempts to spread misinformation is an effective way to fight
the spread of misinformation on climate change [@van2015social]. However, more work is needed to understand what works against misinformation.

 

<!-- ### Takeaways {-}

-   Encouraging energy savings is difficult due to households'
    information barriers, misinformation, 
    heavily discounted future efficiency gains,
    heterogeneity, and cognitive barriers in energy consumption
    decision-making.

-   Several behavioural interventions address these problems adequately.

    -   **Information barriers:** information nudges, energy labels,
        warnings, fact-checking

    -   **Cognitive and effortful process:** information nudges, energy labels, one-stop energy shops

    -   **Motivation:** feedback, goal setting, social norm
        interventions

<!-- 
Policy interventions to promote energy savings at home can be of two types: behaviour change and adoption of energy-efficient technologies.
The "Playing My Part" campaign by the European Commission combined both approaches to address rising energy costs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The Energy Paradox explains why households often do not adopt energy-saving practices, citing information barriers, time discounting, and heterogeneity in consumption patterns.
Information nudges and energy labels effectively promote energy savings by providing easy-to-understand information and making long-term impacts more salient.
One-stop shops, individual feedback with goal setting, intrinsic motivations and social norms, and warnings and fact-checking are additional interventions that encourage energy conservation at home. -->
