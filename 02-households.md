# Saving energy at home {#sec:home}

There are two different types of policy interventions that promote energy savings among households. The first approach involves encouraging families to change their energy consumption behaviours, like turning off lights and appliances when not used, cooking more efficiently, and reducing the use of heating and cooling systems.

The second approach involves stimulating purchases of energy-efficient technologies, such as replacing traditional incandescent bulbs with new LED ones, buying energy-efficient appliances, and installing "smart" home systems. Long-term strategies can also foster investments in home renovations, from small renovations like replacing old windows to reduce heat loss in the winter to installing photovoltaic panels.

In 2022, the European Commission combined both approaches in the "Playing My Part" information campaign, launched in response to the rising energy costs for families after Russia invaded Ukraine.[^playing-my-part]

This campaign urged households, first and foremost, to adopt small changes in their everyday energy consumption, such as adjusting their boiler settings, turning down heating, using less air-conditioning, and driving their cars more economically. Secondly, it also encouraged households to switch to energy-efficient technologies, such as purchasing electric heat pumps or installing programmable "smart" thermostats, while asking Member States to intensify the efforts to facilitate the process.

However, it is difficult to anticipate how information campaigns like "Playing My Part" can influence people to reduce their energy consumption during a crisis.

On the one hand, the recent increase in retail energy prices due to the surge in wholesale prices caused by the embargo on Russia's fossil fuels may cause people to be more concerned about the impact of higher energy bills. Therefore, families may be more inclined to change their energy usage and actively search for ways to reduce their energy consumption to lower their bills. At the same time,  government interventions to calm energy prices, despite being necessary to offer relief to families, could weaken the incentive for households to achieve energy savings. 

On the other hand, many studies have shown that, despite receiving basic information about the potential benefits of good energy conservation practices, only a minority of families tend to adopt such practices, even when cost-effective [@jaffe1994energy]. This means that most families often stick to their usual energy consumption patterns or habits rather than trying to reduce their energy consumption.  

Classical explanations for this Energy Paradox, as it's called, are threefold [@jaffe1994energy]:

* **Information barriers**. Families face multiple barriers either in accessing information or absorbing it. For example, a study, based on a survey of Dutch households, shows that only about half of respondents are aware of their monthly charges for energy consumption, and only 40% understand the correct trade-off between different investment decisions in energy equipment [@brounen2013energy].

* **Time discounting**. Investments in energy efficiency or behavioural changes involve immediate costs (i.e., the cost of installation) and delayed rewards (i.e., lower electricty bills). However, if families heavily discount the future benefits they will enjoy by switching to more energy-efficient actions, they would rather spend their time or money elsewhere today. 

* **Heterogeneity in consumption**. Households are widely heterogeneous concerning their energy consumption patterns. Thus, even if a technology (or behaviour) is profitable on *average*, it may remain unattractive for a large portion of the population.

The above explanations assume that families would make optimal decisions if they had more information about costs and benefits or the market offered them  more personalized solutions to save energy. However, much psychology and behavioural economics evidence have challenged these assumptions on the grounds that people do not typically make optimal decisions, if under the best conditions. On the contrary, individuals often act as they were predictably "irrational" or biased. 

Based on such evidence, other explanations for the Energy Paradox have emerged. Here, we provide two examples: 

* **Time-inconsistent preferences**. People often delay or postpone action despite knowing there will be negative consequences, a form of procrastination. This phenomenon is known as inconsistent time preferences, where people make choices today that are inconsistent with their future wellbeing. For example, people prefer to keep their heating systems at high levels to stay warm and comfortable, but they systematically regret their decision when they receive a high energy bill.  For example, a recent study based on a survey with an experimental design shows that people who exhibited time-inconsistent preferences also tended to over-consume energy at home [@werthschulte2021role].  

* **Loss aversion**. Another example is that, when making energy decisions, families may find it too costly to deviate from their current energy consumption patterns or “status quo” because it involves giving up their current comfortable lifestyle, which they have become accustomed to. Therefore, they may resist making changes, even if the potential rewards are significant, due to the fear of loss. This phenomenon is known as loss aversion, where people fear losses more than they seek equivalent gains. A recent study, based on a large-scale survey of EU citizens, shows that individuals who are loss averse are less likely to invest in energy-efficient appliances or retrofit measures [@schleich2019large].

The reasons for the Energy Paradox remain a question still being studied, and the behavioural factors influencing family energy decisions are still unclear. So, in this report, we take a more practical approach by exploring different interventions found to be successful in the academic literature. This will help us understand the challenges and effectiveness of other solutions. These are summarized in Table \ref{tab:households}. 

## Information nudges and energy labels

Information nudges are energy-saving tips or rules of thumb to inform
or correct behavioural biases via electricity bills, postcards, emails,
and other media. 

Extensive literature shows that information nudges are an effective way
to promote energy savings [@craig1978assessing; @ruokamo2022effect; @dellavalle2020nudging; @caballero2021tackling]. 
However, multiple factors influence the effectiveness of such information nudges, including the credibility of the source [@craig1978assessing], the
delivery method, and the target groups, and it is typically tiny. A
recent meta-analysis based on 52 studies between 2005 and 2020 [@buckley2020prices] shows that the average effect of nudging ranges between 2% and 4%. Despite the tininess of the effects, nudges are typically inexpensive and easy to deploy; thus, the associated cost-effectiveness prompts their use.

Energy labels intuitively convey a technology or commodity's energy
efficiency properties, another form of information nudging. Extensive evidence has proven their effectiveness in various settings, like energy-efficient electric appliances [@dyer1988evaluation; @dellavalle2019can] and residential
buildings [@taranu2018closer; @brounen2011economics] tend to promote investments in long-term energy savings. One common explanation for the efficacy of energy labels is that they provide easy-to-grasp information and make the long-term
impact of energy expenses more salient, thus helping households to
overcome time-inconsistent decision patterns, such as present bias.

## Energy one-stop shops

One-stop shops are interventions that aim to offer integrated solutions and customer-centric services that simplify the decisional process for the renovation of residential building. Indeed, increasing the efficiency of residential buildings through renovations is challenging. It involves a cumbersome and lengthy process in a fragmented market that might discourage consumers. Interventions promoting one-stop shops can bridge the fragmented demand and supply of the renovation value chain. These shops guide citizens and businesses through the renovation journey, from start to finish, and help them overcome hurdles they would otherwise face alone. One-stop shops are relatively new, and so far, 63 case studies have been identified and analysed in Europe [@bertoldi2021role] providing early evidence of their effectiveness. 

## Individual feedback and goal setting

Personalised feedback promotes energy savings by informing households of their energy consumption. There is widespread evidence of their effectiveness, as outlined in several comprehensive reviews [@abrahamse2005review; @andor2018behavioral]. Personalised feedback aims to make energy consumption more "visible" to consumers. Electric companies typically send feedback via periodic email or monthly electricity bills. Sometimes, consumers can receive real-time feedback to adjust their energy consumption to price changes during the day or avoid peaks using smart meters [@aydin2018information]. However, as technology progress and new ways of communication emerge, more work is needed on designing individual feedback to optimise effectiveness in a fast-changing environment.

Setting specific household energy consumption goals is another
critical application of individual feedback. A recent meta-analysis of
studies that combine feedback with goal settings shows that this
combination consistently reduces the energy consumption of private
households [@andor2018behavioral]. Yet, the effect sizes can vary considerably, suggesting that contextual factors influence the success of policy implementation.

## Intrinsic motivations and social norms

In addition to providing information in an easily understandable manner to consumers, behavioural interventions can impact energy savings by targeting individuals' inner (intrinsic) motivation to save energy. For example, interventions can appeal to individuals' environmental values or willingness to adhere to well-established social norms. These interventions assume that people are intrinsically motivated to save energy and will respond to solicitations without personal benefits or financial incentives [@van2015social].

One specific example of behavioural interventions that use the power of
social norms consists of providing individuals with information about
how much energy is used by peers or socially approved energy consumption
levels, thus supplying social comparisons and norms. Since many
individuals care about conforming, this information motivates them to
change their energy consumption. Extensive literature has shown the
effectiveness of this approach in promoting energy savings [@allcott2011social; @caballero2021tackling].

## Warnings and fact-checking

Misinformation is an obstacle to energy savings and environmentally
conscious behaviours, like other informational barriers. For example,
studies have shown widespread energy misinformation about politicised
topics such as the causes of global climate change [@oreskes2004scientific; @farrell2019evidence], and fake news underplaying the concerns about climate change can negatively influence people's perception of the problem and their willingness to invest in energy-efficient technology. Similarly, misinformation about energy use could also affect long-term policies of supply diversification, for example, by giving citizens a wrong idea of the risks of nuclear power [@ho2018can; @ho2019environmental; @ho2022fake].

Behavioural interventions, such as warnings and fact-checking, offer a
promising approach to "inoculate" public attitudes against the spread of
misinformation about energy policies. For example, a recent
experimental survey shows that warning people about politically
motivated attempts to spread misinformation is an effective way to fight
the spread of misinformation on climate change [@van2015social]. However, more work is needed to understand what works against misinformation.

**Takeaways**

    information barriers, heavily discounted future efficiency gains,
    heterogeneity, and cognitive barriers in energy consumption
    decision-making.
