# Conclusion and recommendations {#conclusion}

Behavioural interventions have great potential to support policymakers during energy crises, as they can be implemented quickly and cost-effectively while long-term structural measures are underway. However, it is essential to note that policies should not be designed for the "average" person but should consider individual differences and the specific settings in which they will be implemented.

As our report shows, while information nudging, goal setting and comparative feedback have consistently promoted energy savings, the impact of these interventions on energy consumption can be limited in some cases due to multiple factors. For example, the effectiveness of these interventions may depend on motivation, knowledge, and habits, as well as contextual factors such as the availability of energy-efficient products and services and the social norms surrounding energy use in a particular setting.

Therefore, policymakers should consider a range of behavioural interventions tailored to specific individuals and contexts to maximise their impact on energy consumption. This may include combining multiple interventions, such as providing feedback on energy use and setting energy-saving goals, to increase the likelihood of sustained behaviour change [on this topic, see, e.g., @alt2022synergies]. 

Additionally, policymakers should promote policies that generate positive policy spillovers, such as promoting habits that can be transferred from one context to another or leveraging individual social networks to foster the adoption of energy-efficient behaviours, while at the same time, it should avoid those that produce negative spillovers, like generating “rebound” effects.

Beyond the selection of the right policy mix, the conspicuous evidence of policy spillovers in energy conservation raises more than one question about the evaluation of policies. Looking back at how the effectiveness of many behavioural approaches has been assessed, our work suggests a considerable risk of underestimating the overall effect of information nudging on energy consumption.

This report focused on two critical settings, the home and workplace, which account for about half of the final energy consumption in the EU.  However, we found that home settings are more studied and better understood than work settings.  Homes are often more accessible and less complex for researchers to study, as they typically involve fewer people and fewer variables to control for. 

Conversely, work settings usually apply more complex social and organisational structures and several barriers to data collection, making these settings more challenging to study. Therefore, more research is needed to understand what interventions work and why in this setting. 

Overall, this report helps identify several needs to improve the effectiveness of energy-saving interventions. First, more research is needed to understand better the impact of behavioural interventions in the workplace setting, which needs to be better understood than those in the residential setting. This research should identify which interventions are most effective in promoting energy savings in the workplace and why.

Secondly, there is a need for explicit testing of spillovers from energy-saving behaviours at home to the workplace and vice versa. Many employees spend a significant amount of time at work, and their energy use behaviour at home may influence their behaviour in the workplace. At the same time, the diffusion of remote working practices has transformed some of the time spent at work into work done at home, with deep implications for energy consumption spillovers that are still unclear. By understanding how these spillovers occur, policymakers can design more effective interventions that exploit these dynamics.

Finally, there is a need for a better framework for evaluating the effectiveness of energy-saving policies across different contexts. Different workplaces may have different energy-saving needs, and policies that work well in one context may need to be revised in another. A better framework for evaluating policy effectiveness should consider these contextual factors and help policymakers design more effective interventions tailored to specific contexts.
