# Conclusion and Recommendations {#conclusion}

Behavioural interventions have great potential to support policymakers during energy crises. And the analysis of the relevant academic literature discussed in this report provides several recommendations, summarized in Box \ref{recommendations}.

One key advantage is their timeliness. Unlike long-term structural measures, governments can deploy many behavioural interventions swiftly and economically. Based on our examination, information campaigns, comparative feedback, and addressing intrinsic motivations can reduce energy consumption in the short term and across various settings. They can also contribute to achieving long-term objectives by promoting habits and a culture of energy saving and efficiency. Nevertheless, the effect size of these interventions varies and is sometimes small. Therefore, these measures may be inadequate as standalone to address energy crises.

Our analysis highlights how multiple factors influence the effectiveness of behavioural interventions. Key aspects include people's intrinsic motivation, skills, current habits, and contextual factors such as the availability of energy-efficient products and services. The social norms surrounding energy use in a particular setting are also important drivers. Therefore, our analysis suggests that policymakers should consider a range of behavioural interventions. Such interventions must be tailored to specific groups of individuals and adapt to different contexts to maximise their impact on energy consumption. One way to implement this diversified approach is to combine multiple interventions, such as providing feedback on energy use and setting energy-saving goals; on this topic, see, for example, @alt2022synergies.

Another critical aspect of this report is the role of policy spillovers. We provide compelling evidence of policy spillovers in energy conservation. Consequently, policymakers should promote policies that generate _positive_ policy spillovers, such as promoting habits that can be transferred from one context to another or leveraging individual social networks to foster the adoption of energy-efficient behaviours. At the same time, they should minimise the risk of _negative_ spillovers, like generating “rebound” effects, that will harm the net impact of a policy. 
However, it is challenging to identify specific positive and negative spillovers due to the absence of a comprehensive framework to guide this process. 

In addition, the conspicuous evidence of policy spillovers in energy conservation raises more than one question about the evaluation of policies. Looking back at how the effectiveness of many behavioural approaches has been assessed, our work suggests a considerable risk of underestimating the overall effect of information nudging on energy consumption.

This report focused on two critical settings, the home and workplace, which account for about half of the final energy consumption in the EU.  However, we found that home settings are more studied and better understood than work settings.  Homes are often more accessible and less complex for researchers to study, as they typically involve fewer people and fewer variables to control for. Conversely, work settings usually apply more complex social and organisational structures and several barriers to data collection, making these settings more challenging to study. Therefore, more research is needed to understand what interventions work and why in this setting. 

Overall, this report helps identify several needs to improve the effectiveness of energy-saving interventions. First, more research is needed to understand better the impact of behavioural interventions in the workplace setting, which needs to be better understood than those in the residential environment. This research should identify which interventions are most effective in promoting energy savings in the workplace and why.

Secondly, there is a need to explicitly test spillovers from energy-saving choices at home to the workplace and vice versa. Many employees spend a significant amount of time at work, and their energy use at home may influence their choices in the workplace. At the same time, the diffusion of remote working practices has transformed some of the time spent at work into work done at home, with profound implications for energy consumption spillovers that are still unclear. By understanding how these spillovers occur, policymakers can design more effective interventions that exploit these dynamics.

Finally, our report identifies a need for a better framework for evaluating the effectiveness of energy-saving policies across different contexts. Different workplaces may have different energy-saving needs, and policies that work well in one context may need adjusting in another. A better framework for evaluating policy effectiveness should consider these contextual factors and help policymakers design more effective interventions tailored to specific contexts.
