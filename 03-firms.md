<!-- Main text -->

The focus on interventions stimulating behavioural change at work is partly motivated by evidence showing that employee behaviour significantly impacts the energy consumption of commercial buildings [@azar2014comprehensive]. At the same time, other evidence shows that, while at work, people make fewer energy conservation actions than at home [@lin2019mixing].

One reason for fewer energy conservation actions at work is that employees typically have weak incentives to save energy in the workplace. People are better off in warm rather than cold offices, using air-conditioning in the summer; and they may feel less of a personal connection with energy wastes, such as forgetting to turn off the office lights or computer when leaving, than at home.

Another reason is that employees may feel they have no direct control over the energy systems, which are usually centralised. Such centralised systems have two mean implications for energy consumption. On the one hand, centralised systems may help facility managers oversee the buildings and generate energy savings. On the other, these systems could prevent energy conservation actions by the occupants, such as turning off the lights when not needed.
 
One possible solution is to offer rewards when staff achieves specific energy-saving goals at the individual or organisational level. For example, transportation companies often reward their drivers with cash bonuses or vouchers for consuming less fuel than predetermined levels [@schall2017incentivizing]. However, such compensation schemes can clash with productivity goals when, for example, organisations cannot track individual energy consumption for technical or privacy reasons, and employees have the incentive to free-ride on each other.
 
Other solutions could involve adequate organisational support or creating new opportunities for energy conservation actions. Research based on surveys suggests that employees view the lack of financial incentives for energy savings as less of a factor than missing organisational support, limited opportunities for energy conservation, little time, or even confusion about who has the assigned responsibility to initiate energy savings [@li2019understanding; @staddon2016intervening].

Additionally, intrinsic motivations, such as environmental concerns or for the organisation’s mission and image, and warm-glow feelings can partially compensate for the lack of incentives or organisational support. Several studies have shown that people are willing to contribute to the workplace environment because of their intrinsic motivations, which are fundamental to leading employees to save energy in the workplace [@leygue2017saving].

However, the drivers of energy use in the workplace still need to be better understood. Large-scale empirical studies considering the vast heterogeneity of organisations and behaviours are missing. Despite this limitation, several policy interventions have been tested to change energy-use behaviour in the workplace [@staddon2016intervening]. These interventions can be broadly grouped into three main categories, as in Table \ref{tab:firms}. Below, we discuss a few examples.

## Information, Social Norms, and Peer Education

## Information, social norms, & peer education

Field experiments evaluated the effectiveness of comparative feedback. For example, Carrico and Reimer [-@carrico2011motivating] show that comparative feedback on energy consumption (based on different office buildings) achieved 7% and 4% energy savings, respectively, compared to an *increase* in energy consumption associated with sending informative postcards. Remarkably, such comparative feedback appears effective in widely different settings, even in the industrial sector, a metallurgical company as in @siero1996changing, and there is evidence of long-term effects after removing the comparative feedback [@kamilaris2015case].

Comparative feedback in the workplace can also help coordination and decision-making, such as when using air-conditioning and ventilation in shared spaces or when energy consumption requires some form of consensus among employees. For example, in one notable field experiment [@murakami2007field],  employees could submit their preferences on air conditioning use in real-time with an algorithm providing individual feedback on air conditioning preferences coupled with energy-saving information. The results showed that the algorithm recommendations promoted coordination and produced significant energy savings.


## Monetary and non-monetary rewards

Several studies have shown that non-monetary rewards, including
vouchers, public social reward points [@handgraaf2013public], serious games [@orland2014saving] or the possibility of winning a competition, can reduce energy consumption. For example, a study testing the promotion of energy saving based on points engaged about 60% of employees, leading to a substantial
reduction in energy consumption [@kuntz2012many].

In a serious game called "Energy Chickens", energy saving measured
through plug-in sensors earned participants eggs with which they could
purchase accessories in a virtual farm. The intervention led to
significant energy savings; however, the effects did not seem to last
beyond duration of the game [@orland2014saving]. Similarly, a large-scale competition involving small material rewards among 500 Italian bank branches also
reduced energy consumption [@fanghella2022evaluating].

## Default Settings and Automation

Introducing defaults and automation can significantly impact energy
saving [@staddon2016intervening]. Advanced power strips which automatically switch off computer screens or non-essential circuits can save up to 20% of energy consumption [@sheppy2014reducing]. Also, automatically reducing heating at the end of a workday or before weekends is a promising technological solution to energy over-consumption. However, setting the correct temperature or reasonable defaults is challenging. In one field experiment, researchers found that lowering the default room temperature by 1 or 2 degrees in offices could increase energy consumption as the occupants are more likely to overrule the defaults [@brown2013testing].

Another issue is how defaults could create a differential impact among employees. In response to the current energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many local and national governments defaulted 19 degrees in public buildings to save gas consumption. However, while studies on the effectiveness of this default are rare, anecdotal evidence suggests that this decision may negatively affect workers with special needs and ignores individual perceptions of temperature and comfort.

**Takeaways**

-   Policy interventions for energy savings at work can focus on
    behaviour change or investment in energy-efficient technologies.

-   Lack of direct financial incentives, organisational support, and
    limited energy conservation opportunities influence employee energy
    consumption. Intrinsic motivations can partially compensate for the
    lack of incentives or support.

-   Evidence points to effective behavioural interventions addressing
    these problems.

    -   **Information & Feedback**: comparative feedback activates
        social norms and effectively encourages energy savings.

    -   **Internal competitions & non-monetary rewards:** prizes promote
        energy savings and activate image and reputation concerns that
        will likely enhance social norm interventions.

    -   **Defaults & automation:** Defaults can considerably impact
        energy consumption, but setting the appropriate default is
        challenging and should consider various behavioural responses,
        including the risk of disparities.
