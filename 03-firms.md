# Saving energy at work {#sec:work}

<!-- Main text -->

We now focus on interventions stimulating behavioural change at work. Current policies overlook the importance of human actions and potential energy savings from improved building operations in commercial or industrial settings. However, the evidence suggests a significant potential for savings. A case study on office buildings in the US shows that employee behaviour significantly impacts the energy consumption of commercial buildings and estimates a potential 21% reduction in energy use through simple changes in human operations [@azar2014comprehensive]. Another case study comparing office vs home energy consumption choices observed a strong relationship between behaviours in the two environments, with actions at home influencing actions at work and vice versa, with a tendency of people to take more energy conservation actions at home than at work [@lin2019mixing].

Weak incentives and limited control over energy choices are common explanations for people taking fewer energy conservation actions in the workplace. People are better off in warm rather than cold offices, using air-conditioning in the summer, and they may feel less of a personal connection with energy wastes, such as forgetting to turn off the office lights or computer when leaving, than at home. Additionally, they may have no direct control over the building's centralised energy systems, even when motivated to save energy. The occupants' limited control over energy consumption could be desirable in an energy crisis, and such centralised systems can be a powerful tool for facility managers to oversee the buildings and generate energy savings. However, these systems may lack the flexibility to accommodate the needs of building occupants and result in suboptimal outcomes.

Personal rewards, organisational support and addressing intrinsic motivations are effective strategies to address these problems and achieve energy savings at work. Rewards are used, for example, by transportation companies that reward drivers with cash bonuses or vouchers for consuming less fuel than predetermined levels [@schall2017incentivizing]. However, such individual compensation schemes depend on the organisation's ability to track individual energy consumption consistently and reliably. Surveys suggest that organisations can support energy savings by creating more opportunities, assigning clear responsibilities, and reserving time for energy conservation actions [@li2019understanding]. Additionally, addressing employees’ intrinsic motivations to save energy, such as environmental concerns, warm-glow feelings or concerns for the organisation’s mission and image, might increase employees’ energy saving [@leygue2017saving].

## Interventions in the Workplace 

The factors influencing energy conservation in the workplace still need to be better understood. Large-scale empirical studies that account for the vast heterogeneity of organisations and behaviours are missing. Despite this limitation, several policy interventions have been tested to change energy-use behaviour in the workplace [@staddon2016intervening]. For convenience, we group these interventions into three main categories: feedback, rewards, and defaults or automation, as illustrated in Table \ref{tab:firms}. This section discusses the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of different interventions in each category. Key takeaways are in Box \ref{workplaceInterventions}.

### Feedback

Field experiments evaluated the effectiveness of comparative feedback. For example, Carrico and Reimer [-@carrico2011motivating] show that comparative feedback on energy consumption (based on different office buildings) achieved 7% and 4% energy savings, respectively, compared to an *increase* in energy consumption associated with sending informative postcards. Remarkably, such comparative feedback appears effective in widely different settings, even in the industrial sector, a metallurgical company as in @siero1996changing, and there is evidence of long-term effects after removing the comparative feedback [@kamilaris2015case].

Comparative feedback in the workplace can also help coordination and decision-making, such as when using air-conditioning and ventilation in shared spaces or when energy consumption requires some form of consensus among employees. For example, in one notable field experiment [@murakami2007field],  employees could submit their preferences on air conditioning use in real-time with an algorithm providing individual feedback on air conditioning preferences coupled with energy-saving information. The results showed that the algorithm recommendations promoted coordination and produced significant energy savings.

### Rewards

Several studies have shown that non-monetary rewards, including vouchers, public social reward points [@handgraaf2013public], serious games [@orland2014saving] or the possibility of winning a competition, can reduce energy consumption. For example, a study testing the promotion of energy saving based on points engaged about 60% of employees, leading to a substantial reduction in energy consumption [@kuntz2012many].

In a serious game called "Energy Chickens", energy saving measured
through plug-in sensors earned participants eggs with which they could
purchase accessories in a virtual farm. The intervention led to
significant energy savings; however, the effects did not seem to last
beyond duration of the game [@orland2014saving]. Similarly, a large-scale competition involving small material rewards among 500 Italian bank branches also
reduced energy consumption [@fanghella2022evaluating].

### Defaults and Automation

Introducing defaults and automation can significantly impact energy
saving [@staddon2016intervening]. Advanced power strips which automatically switch off computer screens or non-essential circuits can save up to 20% of energy consumption [@sheppy2014reducing]. Also, automatically reducing heating at the end of a workday or before weekends is a promising technological solution to energy over-consumption. However, setting the correct temperature or reasonable defaults is challenging. In one field experiment, researchers found that lowering the default room temperature by 1 or 2 degrees in offices could increase energy consumption as the occupants are more likely to overrule the defaults [@brown2013testing].

Another issue is how defaults could create a differential impact among employees. In response to the current energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many local and national governments defaulted 19 degrees in public buildings to save gas consumption. However, while studies on the effectiveness of this default are rare, anecdotal evidence suggests that this decision may negatively affect workers with special needs and ignores individual perceptions of temperature and comfort.

<!-- **Takeaways**

-   Policy interventions for energy savings at work can focus on
    behaviour change or investment in energy-efficient technologies.

-   Lack of direct financial incentives, organisational support, and
    limited energy conservation opportunities influence employee energy
    consumption. Intrinsic motivations can partially compensate for the
    lack of incentives or support.

-   Evidence points to effective behavioural interventions addressing
    these problems.

    -   **Information & Feedback**: comparative feedback activates
        social norms and effectively encourages energy savings.

    -   **Internal competitions & non-monetary rewards:** prizes promote
        energy savings and activate image and reputation concerns that
        will likely enhance social norm interventions.

    -   **Defaults & automation:** Defaults can considerably impact
        energy consumption, but setting the appropriate default is
        challenging and should consider various behavioural responses,
        including the risk of disparities. -->
