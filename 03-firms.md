<!-- Main text -->

As for households, policy interventions can either focus on reducing energy usage by changing the behaviour of employees and staff members or encourage the management to invest in energy-efficient technologies and practices. This report focuses on interventions to motivate workers to change their energy behaviour at work. Public policies stimulating firms to invest in energy efficiency solutions or green practices have been widely discussed, e.g., @decanio1998investment. However, these policies are part of a long-term strategy, while this report focuses on first-line-of-action interventions.

Evidence shows that employee behaviour significantly impacts the energy consumption of commercial buildings [@azar2014comprehensive] and that people at work make fewer energy conservation actions than at home [@lin2019mixing].

The literature highlights two reasons for less energy conservation at work: incentives and direct control. Compared to at home, people at work typically have weak incentives to save energy as there is no personal cost involved if energy is wasted (for instance, when one forgets to turn off the heating, the lights, or the computer when leaving the office). Also, at work, many energy systems are centralised. Therefore,  employees may feel they have no direct control over the energy consumption. Consequently, whereas centralised systems can help facility managers monitor the building and generate energy savings, these systems might also prevent individuals from feeling responsible for energy-saving actions.
 
As solutions, personal rewards, organisational support, and addressing intrinsic motivations can be effective strategies to achieve energy savings at work. Rewards are used, for example, by transportation companies that reward their drivers with cash bonuses or vouchers for consuming less fuel than predetermined levels [@schall2017incentivizing]. However, such individual compensation schemes depend on an organisation's ability to track individual energy consumption and design rewards aligning with productivity goals. In surveys, employees suggest that organisations can support saving energy by creating more opportunities for energy-saving actions, assigning clear responsibilities, and reserving time [@li2019understanding; @staddon2016intervening]. Additionally, addressing employees’ intrinsic motivations to save energy, such as environmental concerns, warm-glow feelings or concerns for the organisation’s mission and image, might increase employees’ energy saving [@leygue2017saving].

However, the drivers of energy use in the workplace still need to be better understood. Large-scale empirical studies considering the vast heterogeneity of organisations and behaviours are missing. Despite this limitation, several policy interventions have been tested to change energy-use behaviour in the workplace [@staddon2016intervening]. These interventions can be broadly grouped into three main categories, as in Table \ref{tab:firms}. Below, we discuss a few examples.

## Information, Social Norms, and Peer Education

As for the residential sector, several studies have investigated information nudges to give employees feedback on their energy consumption patterns via emails and visualisations of energy data, such as live dashboards. These interventions often aim to activate social norms via comparative feedback across departments or groups of colleagues and can take various forms. Staddon et al. [-@staddon2016intervening] provide a systematic review of feedback interventions delivered through various media (postcards, posters, leaflets, emails) in one shot or repeated. Some of these interventions combine feedback with gamification. Examples include mobile video games based on actual energy use data [@oppong2020developing].  

Field experiments evaluated the effectiveness of comparative feedback. For example, Carrico and Reimer [-@carrico2011motivating] show that comparative feedback on energy consumption (based on different office buildings) achieved 7% and 4% energy savings, respectively, compared to an *increase* in energy consumption associated with sending informative postcards. Remarkably, such comparative feedback appears effective in widely different settings, even in the industrial sector, a metallurgical company as in @siero1996changing, and there is evidence of long-term effects after removing the comparative feedback [@kamilaris2015case].

Comparative feedback in the workplace can also help coordination and decision-making, such as when using air-conditioning and ventilation in shared spaces or when energy consumption requires some form of consensus among employees. For example, in one notable field experiment [@murakami2007field],  employees could submit their preferences on air conditioning use in real-time with an algorithm providing individual feedback on air conditioning preferences coupled with energy-saving information. The results showed that the algorithm recommendations promoted coordination and produced significant energy savings.


## Monetary and non-monetary rewards

Several studies have shown that non-monetary incentives, such as games and competitions awarding employees virtual points, can effectively decrease energy consumption [@handgraaf2013public; @orland2014saving]. For example, one study tested a points-based system to encourage energy-saving actions at work, resulting in the active participation of approximately 60% of employees and a substantial reduction in energy consumption [@kuntz2012many]. Another study employed a [Serious Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game) called Energy Chickens, where participants earned virtual eggs by saving energy, which they could use to purchase accessories for a virtual farm. While this intervention led to significant energy savings, the effects did not persist beyond the game's duration [@orland2014saving]. Likewise, a large-scale competition involving 500 Italian bank branches, offering small material rewards, successfully decreased energy consumption [@fanghella2022evaluating].

While competitions and virtual rewards effectively decrease energy consumption, low-powered monetary incentives, like offering small cash rewards, rarely show an effect, and when they do, the effects are only short-lived [@handgraaf2013public; @schall2017incentivizing]. This evidence suggests that achieving consistent and significant workplace energy savings requires more than low-powered monetary incentives.

## Default Settings and Automation

Introducing defaults and automation can significantly impact energy
saving [@staddon2016intervening]. Advanced power strips which automatically switch off computer screens or non-essential circuits can save up to 20% of energy
consumption [@sheppy2014reducing]. Also, automatically reducing heating at the end of a workday or before weekends is a promising technological solution to
energy over-consumption. However, setting the correct temperature or
reasonable defaults is challenging. In one clever field experiment,
researchers found that lowering the default room temperature by 1 or 2
degrees in offices could increase energy consumption as the occupants
are more likely to overrule the defaults [@brown2013testing].

Another issue is how defaults could create a differential impact among employees. In response to the current energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many local and national governments defaulted 19 degrees in public buildings to save gas consumption. However, while studies on the effectiveness of this default are rare, anecdotal evidence suggests that this decision may negatively affect workers with special needs and ignores individual perceptions of temperature and comfort.

<!-- **Takeaways**

-   Policy interventions for energy savings at work can focus on
    behaviour change or investment in energy-efficient technologies.

-   Lack of direct financial incentives, organisational support, and
    limited energy conservation opportunities influence employee energy
    consumption. Intrinsic motivations can partially compensate for the
    lack of incentives or support.

-   Evidence points to effective behavioural interventions addressing
    these problems.

    -   **Information & Feedback**: comparative feedback activates
        social norms and effectively encourages energy savings.

    -   **Internal competitions & non-monetary rewards:** prizes promote
        energy savings and activate image and reputation concerns that
        will likely enhance social norm interventions.

    -   **Defaults & automation:** Defaults can considerably impact
        energy consumption, but setting the appropriate default is
        challenging and should consider various behavioural responses,
        including the risk of disparities. -->
