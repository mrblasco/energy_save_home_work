1. Behavioural interventions offer timely and cost-effective solutions during energy crises. They can be swiftly deployed by governments and have the potential to reduce energy consumption in the short term while promoting long-term energy-saving habits and culture.

2. The effectiveness of behavioural interventions is influenced by various factors, including intrinsic motivation, skills, habits, and contextual factors such as the availability of energy-efficient products. To maximize impact, policymakers should consider a range of tailored interventions and combine multiple strategies to address energy consumption effectively.

3. Policy spillovers play a significant role in energy conservation. Policymakers should promote policies that generate positive spillover effects, enabling energy-efficient behaviours to transfer across different contexts. They should also minimize negative spillovers, such as rebound effects, that can undermine policy effectiveness.

4. Evaluation of behavioural interventions in energy conservation requires a comprehensive framework. Current assessment methods risk underestimating the overall effect of information nudging on energy consumption. A better evaluation framework is needed to accurately measure the impact of interventions and guide policy design.

5. Further research is necessary to understand the effectiveness of behavioural interventions in the workplace setting. Work settings present more complexity and barriers to data collection compared to residential settings. Identifying the most effective strategies for promoting energy savings in the workplace will contribute to a comprehensive approach to tackling energy consumption.

1. Tailored Behavioral Interventions: Implement a range of behavioural interventions tailored to specific individuals and contexts to maximize their impact on energy consumption.

2. Promote Positive Policy Spillovers: Foster policies that generate positive spillover effects, enabling the transfer of energy-efficient behaviours across different contexts while minimizing negative spillovers.

3. Research in Workplace Settings: Conduct further research to understand the effectiveness of behavioural interventions in workplace settings and identify the most effective strategies for promoting energy savings.

4. Improved Framework for Policy Evaluation: Develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the effectiveness of energy-saving policies across different contexts, considering contextual factors to design targeted interventions.

# Introduction

An increasing global energy demand, geopolitical instabilities, and the challenges of transitioning to clean energy sources may amplify the likelihood of energy crises. Energy crises are complex phenomena that demand urgent action on both _systemic_ and _individual_ levels. For example, the 2022 energy crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine urged [many countries](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00969-9) to implement swift measures to lower their reliance on Russian natural gas, achieve significant energy savings quickly, and safeguard citizens and businesses from energy shortages and increased costs.

For policymakers facing an energy crisis, behavioural interventions represent an appealing solution to quickly and effectively promote significant energy savings while minimising disruptions to everyday lives. These behavioural approaches, which include information provision, non-monetary incentives, social norms, and social interactions, encourage voluntary energy savings by tapping into human behaviour, influencing individuals' and communities' choices, habits, and preferences rather than imposing unpopular and restrictive limitations. 

A large body of research has found various applications of behavioural interventions to foster energy savings, from the early studies in the 1980s [@shama1983energy; @shama1983energy; @coltrane1986social] to more recent ones [@allcott2010behavior; @allcott2014short; @nisa2019meta]. However, there is little discussion of the peculiarities of using these tools during energy crises. This report aims to fill this gap by exploring the potential of behavioural interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of energy crises, examining their effectiveness, scalability, and long-term impact on energy conservation.

One key question in this report is to what extent behavioural interventions should target residential or commercial/public buildings. Estimating the potential impact of a policy that integrates both contexts can be challenging. In the EU, for example, while residential buildings account for a larger share of final energy consumption (households for 28% and commercial/public services for 14%, according to [Eurostat, Simplified energy balances](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/NRG_BAL_S/default/table?lang=en)), office spaces have a 41% higher energy consumption per square meter than private households, according to the [Odyssee database on energy consumption of buildings](http://www.indicators.odyssee-mure.eu/). Therefore, office space interventions could have a relatively more significant impact, even though they account for a smaller share of the total energy consumption.  At the same time, the net effect will ultimately depend on how individuals will respond and internalise the benefits of energy savings at home versus in the workplace, which is unclear.  

Another critical point is the possibility that the effects of one policy targeting a specific context can influence or “spill over” to another. For example, a strategy harnessing intrinsic motivations encouraging people to take energy-saving actions at home can also increase the likelihood of these individuals replicating the same environmentally-friendly actions at their workplace. Likewise, implementing a policy that cultivates a culture of energy savings at work can effectively translate into consistently adopting energy-saving practices at home. Despite these phenomena being frequent and a growing interest in the academic literature, policymakers do not pay proper attention to the role of spillovers, and they seldom explicitly promote positive spillovers into energy-saving policy. 

This report addresses these issues by reviewing the academic literature on interventions fostering energy conservation at home and in the workplace, examining how people responded, and discussing the need for tailored approaches to maximise effectiveness in both contexts. Our analysis highlights that behavioural interventions can significantly generate energy savings at home and work despite many differences in how people consume energy in both contexts and people’s tendency to internalise the benefits of energy savings better at home. It also discusses a few simple ideas to leverage spillovers, such as promoting habits, green identity, and peer influence. It further highlights the complexities that spillover effects can introduce when assessing the effectiveness of policies through ex-ante and impact evaluations. For instance, an approach that incentivises energy savings at home may inadvertently lead to increased energy waste in the workplace, resulting in unclear net effects on overall energy consumption.

This report proceeds as follows. First, it discusses the academic literature and scientific evidence on the effectiveness of policy interventions specifically targeting energy savings among households (Section \ref{home}) and those aimed at influencing behaviours within the workplace (Section \ref{work}). Subsequently, it explores possible spillover effects between the two spheres and how to integrate actions targeting residential or workplace behaviours into uniform policy interventions (Section \ref{spillovers}). The last section concludes the report and provides several policy recommendations.
