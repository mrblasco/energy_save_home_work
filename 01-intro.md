# Introduction

The path to climate neutral economy demands us to change habits. Since changing habits is hard, governemnts must promote the change with policies to foster energy savings and efficiency. These policies typically involve individual-level and structural measures, such as X, Y and Z. Events like Russia's invasion of Ukraine that create a sudden shock in the energy supply, demand short-term policies. Designing these policies can be challenging because (1) rising cost of energy (2) curtailment is costly, especially for poor, (3) disruption of the economy (4) economic uncertainty, etc. Behavioural interventions offer a solution that is inexpensive and fast.

The halt on energy supply imports from Russia has multiple effects on the path [to a climate-neutral European Union (EU)](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en). On the positive side, it forces the EU to diversify its energy sources, accelerating the transition to renewable energy and reducing fossil fuel dependence. However, there are negative consequences, such as short-term energy shortages and increased energy costs for households and businesses. The European Commission proposed various measures to address the current situation outlined in the [RePowerEU plan](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en). The plan has two primary objectives: expediting investments in diversifying the energy supply, mainly focusing on renewables, and encouraging reductions in energy demand. The plan outlines _structural_ and _individual-level_ measures to achieve these objectives. Structural measures focus on achieving long-term effects, such as creating new infrastructures, while individual-level measures tend to have more immediate impacts.


<!-- Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 inadvertently expedited the shift towards renewable energy sources but generated further economic challenges. One consequence has been the sudden halt in natural gas imports from Russia. In 2021, Russia accounted for approximately 45% of EU gas imports and nearly 40% of its total gas consumption. The interruption in natural gas imports has forced the EU to search for different sources, accelerating the EU's transition from reliance on fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources. At the same time, the shock in energy supplies has necessitated urgent and extraordinary measures to address potential energy shortages and the resulting increase in energy costs for households and businesses.  -->

Russia's invasion has triggered two objectives --- (a) and (b). The European Commission has proposed that Member States adopt voluntary reductions and suggested a series of interventions to achieve these reductions. These interventions could be categorized into individual-level, such as xxxx, and structural, such as xxxx. The individual-level interventions were outlined in the Playing My Part campaign by the European Commission in collaboration with the IEA. 

Following this communication, all member States agreed to voluntarily reduce their energy consumption by XX% and implemented various policies to achieve this goa. According to Bruegel, several ms used campaigns and ...   

This report examines individual-level measures from a behavioural perspective, discussing the potential for energy savings and efficiency improvements. By doing so, we aim to address the following questions: What strategies can governments employ to incentivise individuals and businesses to conserve energy without enforcing expensive restrictions on energy usage? What first line of action can governments implement, and what are the possible long-term effects?

Expert studies underscore the considerable impact of behavioural interventions in addressing energy consumption and its associated environmental impacts. According to the [International Energy Agency (IEA)](www.iea.org), behavioural interventions that promote small changes in daily activities among households and businesses have the potential to immediately lower energy demand by 5% at a relatively low cost. 

Another ehavioural interventions' effectiveness varies between office spaces and residential buildings. While residential buildings account for a larger share of final energy consumption (households for 28% and commercial/public services for 14%, [Eurostat, Simplified energy balances](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/NRG_BAL_S/default/table?lang=en)), office spaces have a 41% higher energy consumption per square meter than private households ([Odyssee database](http://www.indicators.odyssee-mure.eu/)). Therefore, office space interventions could be relatively more effective. At the same time, research suggests that people tend to internalise better the benefits of saving energy at home than at work.

<!-- However, further studies are needed to explore and understand the underlying factors influencing people's perception and behavior regarding energy conservation in different contexts.  -->


<!-- However, more work is needed to understand what measures can help people save energy in offices and residential buildings effectively and how to integrate these interventions into a coherent policy -->

<!-- Therefore, interventions targeting office spaces could be more effective than those targeting residential buildings, despite the latter accounting for a larger share of final consumption. However, more work is needed to understand what measures can help people save energy in offices and residential buildings effectively and how to integrate these interventions into a coherent policy. -->

Perusing numerous experimental studies on behavioural interventions promoting energy conservation, we provide a roadmap identifying effective strategies to address the peculiarities of energy consumption at home and work. We also highlight the difficulties in designing effective behavioural interventions and evaluating these measures' effectiveness. 

Our analysis highlights that even though there are differences in how people conserve energy at home versus in the office, the behaviours in one setting can influence and spill over into the other. For example, if someone is diligent about turning off lights and unplugging electronics at home, they may be more likely to do the same at work. 

Similarly, if someone sees energy-saving behaviours being encouraged or rewarded in the workplace, they may also be more likely to adopt them at home. However, these spillover effects complicate policy evaluation and are complex to integrate into policy design. 

<!-- So, we encourage policymakers to work on better considering these effects, ensuring that their interventions do not offset but amplify energy conservation across contexts. -->

Concerning how to incorporate spillovers into policy, the report discusses ideas such as promoting habits, green identity, and peer influence. At the same time, it also calls for more empirical studies to test the effectiveness of these interventions.

The report also examines how spillovers may complicate evaluating policies' effectiveness. For example, a policy incentivising energy savings at home may simultaneously encourage more energy waste at work, with unclear net effects on energy consumption. 

This report is as follows. First, it discusses the academic literature and the available scientific evidence on the effectiveness of policy interventions targeting households (Section \ref{sec:home}) and those targeting behaviours at work (Section \ref{sec:work}). It then discusses integrating actions targeting residential or workplace behaviours into uniform policy interventions to better account for possible spillover effects between the two spheres (Section \ref{sec:spillovers}). 


<!-- This literature review complements previous work primarily focused on policies to mobilise households to save energy [REF]. However, more research is needed to inform guidelines and recommendations. We identify two promising areas for future work. First, policymakers should support studies investigating workplace energy savings, especially regarding new forms of work organisation, such as remote working, online platforms, and electric transportation. A second promising avenue for research is developing new methods enabling policymakers to design policies that explicitly leverage spillovers between different settings and correctly consider these effects in the impact evaluation of their interventions. -->
