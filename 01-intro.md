# Introduction

The European Union (EU) faces multiple complex energy challenges to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 set out by the [European Green Deal](). Russia's invasion of Ukraine has further complicated the transition. On the one hand, it has led to a sudden halt in natural gas imports from Russia, accelerating the shift toward renewable energy sources. On the other, the embargo on Russian fossil fuels has also generated a negative shock to the economy of many countries, which required urgent and extraordinary measures to tackle potential shortages of energy supplies and the rising energy cost for families and businesses.

The European Commission proposed several measures articulated in the RePowerEU plan to deal with the current situation.[^repowereu] The plan's two main pillars are accelerating investments to diversify the energy supply, especially renewables, and promoting energy demand reductions. 

However, while the plan lists several "structural" measures to diversify the energy supply and reduce energy usage, it also recognises the need to incentivise citizens and businesses to make small behavioural changes to save energy. 

This "behavioural" approach seeks to reduce energy usage while limiting negative economic impacts in the short term, especially given the limited time available to implement the necessary solutions to diversify the energy supply.  By encouraging individuals and businesses to make small changes to save energy, governments can reduce the overall energy demand without curtailing energy usage or rushing investments, which could lead to adverse effects on the economy and a higher fiscal cost of the investments. 

The [International Energy Agency](www.iea.org) estimates that behavioural interventions to reduce gas and oil will immediately lower demand by 5% at a low cost, providing evidence of the potential effectiveness of behavioural interventions to reduce gas and oil consumption. 

A breakdown of final energy consumption in the EU among different end users shows that households account for 28% and commercial/public services for 14%.[^eurostat] At the same time, statistics on energy consumption by building type show that office spaces have a 41% higher energy consumption per square meter than private households.[^odyssee]

Based on these statistics, interventions targeting office spaces could be more effective than those targeting residential buildings, despite the latter accounting for a larger share of final consumption. However, more work is needed to understand what measures can help people save energy in offices and residential buildings effectively, and how to integrate these interventions into a coherent policy.

This technical report identifies and discusses various behavioural public interventions governments can adopt or promote to encourage behavioural change in households and firms. We focus especially on a "first line of action" that governments can implement before or in addition to taking more drastic or coercive measures. But we also discuss possible long-term effects.  

Perusing numerous experimental studies on behavioural interventions promoting energy conservation, we provide a roadmap identifying effective strategies to address the peculiarities of energy consumption at home and work. We also point out the difficulties in designing effective behavioural interventions and evaluating these measures' effectiveness. 

Our analysis highlights that even though there are differences in how people conserve energy at home versus in the office, the behaviours in one setting can influence and spill over into the other. For example, if someone is diligent about turning off lights and unplugging electronics at home, they may be more likely to do the same at work. 

Similarly, if someone sees energy-saving behaviours being encouraged or rewarded in the workplace, they may also be more likely to adopt them at home. However, these spillover effects complicate policy evaluation and are complex to integrate into policy design. 


<!-- So, we encourage policymakers to work on better considering these effects, ensuring that their interventions do not offset but amplify energy conservation across contexts. -->

Concerning how to incorporate spillovers into policy, the report discusses a few key ideas, such as promoting habits, green identity, and peer influence, while it also calls for more empirical studies on testing the effectiveness of these interventions.

The report also examines how spillovers may complicate evaluating policies' effectiveness. For example, a policy incentivising energy savings at home may simultaneously encourage more energy waste at work, with unclear net effects on energy consumption. 

This report is organized as follows. First, it discusses the academic literature and the available scientific evidence on the effectiveness of policy interventions targeting households (Section \ref{sec:home}) and those targeting behaviours at work (Section \ref{sec:work}). It then discusses integrating actions targeting residential or workplace behaviours into uniform policy interventions to better account for possible spillover effects between the two spheres (Section \ref{sec:spillovers}). 


<!-- This literature review complements previous work primarily focused on policies to mobilise households to save energy [REF]. However, more research is needed to inform guidelines and recommendations. We identify two promising areas for future work. First, policymakers should support studies investigating workplace energy savings, especially regarding new forms of work organisation, such as remote working, online platforms, and electric transportation. A second promising avenue for research is developing new methods enabling policymakers to design policies that explicitly leverage spillovers between different settings and correctly consider these effects in the impact evaluation of their interventions. -->
