# Introduction

The increasing global energy demand, geopolitical instabilities, and the challenges of transitioning to sustainable energy sources have amplified the likelihood of energy crises. Energy crises are complex phenomena that demand urgent action on both _systemic_ and _individual_ levels. For instance, [Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted many countries](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00969-9) to implement swift measures to lower their reliance on Russian natural gas while achieving significant energy savings safeguarding citizens and businesses from energy shortages and increased costs. A growing body of research suggests that behavioural interventions represent a promising solution to quickly and effectively promote considerable energy savings while minimising disruptions to everyday lives [@allcott2010behavior], thus complementing the action of structural interventions underway.

These behavioural approaches, which include information provision, non-monetary incentives, social norms, and social interactions, tap into human behaviour, encouraging voluntary energy savings by understanding and influencing individuals' and communities' choices, habits, and preferences rather than imposing unpopular and restrictive limitations. However, deploying behavioural interventions can be challenging. It requires considering and leveraging several critical factors, such as understanding possible cognitive and psychological barriers or enablers of behavioural changes. Furthermore, the impact of these measures can vary among individuals and contexts, complicating the design choices for policymakers. This report explores the potential of behavioural interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of energy crises, examining their effectiveness, scalability, and long-term impact on energy conservation.

<!-- Another key advantage of behavioural interventions is their flexibility. These interventions extend beyond households and can effectively target various entities, including small businesses, office workers, large corporations, and public authorities. [Many organisations have their internal behavioural units](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/lessons-from-the-front-line-of-corporate-nudging) to boost productivity, promote energy-conscious behaviours, or help implement sustainability initiatives. Consequently, governments can launch information campaigns at the firm level to encourage or facilitate these behavioural interventions or even make them mandatory for specific firms, including public authorities.  -->

One key question in this report is to what extent behavioural interventions should target residential or commercial/public buildings. Estimating the potential impact of a policy that integrates both contexts can be challenging. In the EU, for example, while residential buildings account for a larger share of final energy consumption (households for 28% and commercial/public services for 14%, according to [Eurostat, Simplified energy balances](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/NRG_BAL_S/default/table?lang=en)), office spaces have a 41% higher energy consumption per square meter than private households, according to the [Odyssee database](http://www.indicators.odyssee-mure.eu/). Therefore, office space interventions could have a relatively more significant impact, even though they account for a smaller share of the total energy consumption.  However, the net effect will ultimately depend on how individuals will respond and internalise the benefits of energy savings at home versus in the workplace. 

Another critical point is the possibility that the effects of one policy targeting a specific context can influence or “spill over” to another. For example, a strategy harnessing intrinsic motivations encouraging people to take energy-saving actions at home can also increase the likelihood of these individuals replicating the same environmentally-friendly actions at their workplace. Likewise, implementing a policy that cultivates a culture of energy savings at work can effectively translate into consistently adopting energy-saving practices at home. 

However, people's responses to behavioural interventions and how these responses vary across different contexts are still poorly understood. Similarly, policymakers do not pay proper attention to the role of spillovers. Consequently, despite a growing interest in the academic literature, incorporating spillovers into energy-saving policy is still rare.

This report addresses these issues by reviewing the academic literature on interventions fostering energy conservation at home and in the workplace, examining how people responded, and discussing the need for tailored approaches to maximise effectiveness in both contexts. Our analysis highlights that behavioural interventions can significantly generate energy savings at home and work despite many differences in how people consume energy in both contexts and people’s tendency to internalise the benefits of energy savings better at home. It also discusses a few simple ideas to leverage spillovers, such as promoting habits, green identity, and peer influence. It further highlights the complexities that spillover effects can introduce when assessing the effectiveness of policies through ex-ante and impact evaluations. For instance, an approach that incentivises energy savings at home may inadvertently lead to increased energy waste in the workplace, resulting in unclear net effects on overall energy consumption.

This report proceeds as follows. First, it discusses the academic literature and scientific evidence on the effectiveness of policy interventions specifically targeting energy savings among households (Section \ref{sec:home}) and those aimed at influencing behaviours within the workplace (Section \ref{sec:work}). Subsequently, it explores possible spillover effects between the two spheres and how to integrate actions targeting residential or workplace behaviours into uniform policy interventions (Section \ref{sec:spillovers}). The last section concludes the report and provides several policy recommendations.

\begin{keypoints}{Key research questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item To what extent should behavioural interventions target residential or commercial/public buildings, considering their potential impact on energy consumption and the response of individuals in each context?
\item How do individuals respond to behavioural interventions in different contexts (home vs workplace), and what factors influence their willingness to internalize the benefits of energy savings?
\item What are the spillover effects of energy-saving policies targeting one context (e.g., home or workplace) on the behavior and energy consumption patterns in the other context, and how can these effects be effectively leveraged?
\item What are the complexities and challenges associated with assessing the overall effectiveness of policies considering spillover effects and the potential trade-offs between energy savings in different contexts?
